EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.

Even in the fledgling days of the Internet, EFF understood that protecting access to technology was central to advancing freedom for all. In the years that followed, EFF used our fiercely independent voice to clear the way for open source software, encryption, security research, file sharing tools, and a world of emerging technologies.

Today, EFF uses the unique expertise of leading technologists, activists, and attorneys in our efforts to defend free speech online, fight illegal surveillance, advocate for users and innovators, and support freedom-enhancing technologies.

Together, we forged a vast network of concerned members and partner organizations spanning the globe. EFF advises policymakers and educates the press and the public through comprehensive analysis, educational guides, activist workshops, and more. EFF empowers hundreds of thousands of individuals through our [Action Center](https://act.eff.org/ "EFF Action Center") and has become a leading voice in online rights debates.

EFF is a donor-funded U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that depends on your support to continue fighting for users.

Systems Administrator

leez, a second-person narrative. You're quite fond of freely-modifiable and redistributable things. While compiling your college thesis on the free and open-source software movements, you rebuilt their course-management servers with free and open-source software. You are a social justice advocate that is often found evangelizing worker-run factories or encryption. Lately you also find pleasure in the ancient art of seafaring, the modern art of flash mobs, phaselocking bullymongs, and trying to make music with that electronic keyboard.

Free Speech
===========

The online world offers the promise of speech with minimal barriers and without borders. New technologies and widespread internet access have radically enhanced our ability to express ourselves; criticize those in power; gather and report the news; and make, adapt, and share creative works. Vulnerable communities have also found space to safely meet,  grow, and make themselves heard without being drowned out by the powerful. The ability to freely exchange ideas also benefits innovators, who can use all of their capabilities to build even better tools for their communities and the world.

In the U.S., the First Amendment grants individuals the right to speak without government interference. And globally, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protects the right to speak both online and offline. Everyone should be able to take advantage of this promise. And no government should have the power to decide who gets to speak and who doesn’t.

Government threats to online speakers are significant. Laws and policies have enabled censorship regimes, controlled access to information, increased government surveillance, and minimized user security and safety.

At the same time, online speakers’ reliance on private companies that facilitate their speech has grown considerably. Online services’ content moderation decisions have far-reaching impacts on speakers around the world. This includes social media platforms and online sites selectively enforcing their Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and similar rules to censor dissenting voices and contentious ideas. That’s why these services must ground their moderation decisions in human rights and due process principles.

As the law and technology develops alongside our ever-evolving world, it’s important that these neither create nor reinforce obstacles to people’s ability to speak, organize, and advocate for change. Both the law and technology must enhance people’s ability to speak. That’s why EFF fights to protect free speech - because everyone has the right to share ideas and experiences safely, especially when we disagree.





Privacy
=======

New technologies are radically advancing our freedoms, but they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of privacy. National and international laws have yet to catch up with the evolving need for privacy that comes with new digital technologies. Respect for individuals' autonomy, anonymous speech, and the right to free association must be balanced against legitimate concerns like law enforcement. EFF fights in the courts and Congress to maintain your privacy rights in the digital world, and works with partners around the globe to support the development of privacy-protecting technologies.

Your cell phone helps you keep in touch with friends and family, but it also makes it easier for the government to track your location.

Your Web searches about sensitive medical information might seem a secret between you and your search engine, but companies like Google are creating a treasure trove of personal information by logging your online activities, and making it potentially available to any party wielding enough cash or a subpoena.

And the next time you try to board a plane, watch out—you might be turned away after being mistakenly placed on a government watch list, or be forced to open your email in the security line.

Several governments have also chosen to use malware to engage in extra-legal spying or system sabotage for dissidents or non-citizens, all in the name of “national security.”

As privacy needs evolve, so too should our regulatory regimes. National governments must put legal checks in place to prevent abuse of state powers, and international bodies need to consider how a changing technological environment shapes security agencies’ best practices. Above all, we need to respect the rights of autonomy, anonymity, association, and expression that privacy makes possible, while also taking into account legitimate law enforcement concerns.

Read our work on privacy issues below, and join EFF to help support our efforts.

Creativity & Innovation
=======================

Our digital future depends on our ability to access, use, and build on technology. A few media or political interests shouldn’t have unfair technological or legal advantages over the rest of us. Unfortunately, litigious copyright and patent owners can abuse the law to inhibit fair use and stifle competition. Internet service providers can give established content companies an advantage over startups and veto the choices you make in how to use the Internet. The Electronic Frontier Foundation fights against these unfair practices and defends digital creators, inventors, and ordinary technology users. We work to protect and strengthen fair use, innovation, open access, net neutrality, and your freedom to tinker.

In principle, intellectual property laws (or IP law, a [catchall term](https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/the-term "Intellectual Property: The Term") for copyright, patents, and trademarks) should serve the public in a number of ways. Copyrights provide economic incentives for authors and artists to create and distribute new expressive works. Patents reward inventors for sharing new inventions with the public, granting them a temporary and limited monopoly on them in return for contributing to the public body of knowledge. Trademarks help protect customers by encouraging companies to make sure products match the quality standards the public expects.

Unfortunately, our IP regimes have strayed far from their original purposes. Too often, protections for free speech and innovation are seemingly forgotten as soon as someone cries “infringement.” An unproven allegation that your video or blog post infringes copyright, or that your domain name infringes someone’s trademark, can be enough to shut down perfectly lawful speech. A patent troll can kill a small company with a bogus lawsuit based on a questionable patent that shouldn’t have been issued in the first place.

Some of these laws simply haven’t adapted well to modern technology. A warped development in copyright law has made it illegal in many countries to modify or even look at the software built into the products you own, even if you’re doing it for completely lawful purposes. Copyright’s legal reinforcement of digital locks, paired with extreme criminal penalties for infringement, has intimidated a generation of would-be researchers, tinkerers, and inventors. And ongoing expansions of copyright law are often decided in secret, closed-door meetings before the public is ever allowed to debate them

Imbalanced copyright law—and overzealous enforcement—generally favors powerful voices that have a great deal of influence in culture. Extreme copyright laws can intimidate new types of creators, especially those who use new media techniques to criticize dominant culture or powerful entities. Online platforms that support new, independent creators can only thrive when they don’t risk severe legal repercussions for their users’ activities. Similarly, when only the most privileged members of society have access to up-to-date research, only those members can build on that research to create new ideas and inventions. That’s why EFF supports open access to research, so everyone can build on and contribute to our knowledge commons.

Just as new voices can’t thrive if copyright law doesn’t recognize their rights, new players must also have access to the same resources as established ones. When Internet service providers can give preferential treatment to certain content or hardware companies, those technologies harden to the accelerating effect of competition and users can’t access new sources of information and innovative new services. EFF believes that Internet users should have the freedom to use technology however they like without service providers artificially restricting their experience.

Whether we’re fighting patent trolls in court; arguing in Congress for more balanced copyright laws; or urging governments, funders, and educational institutions to adopt open access policies, EFF is committed to building a society that supports creativity and innovation, where established players in the marketplace for technology and culture aren’t allowed to silence the next generation of creators.





Transparency
============

Knowing “what the government is up to” is often the first step in ensuring that the government respects the civil liberties of its citizens. Transparency is especially important given the government’s increasingly secretive use of new technologies for law enforcement and national security purposes. From cell phone location tracking, the use of surveillance drones, secret interpretations of electronic surveillance law, and the expanding use of biometrics, EFF wants to hold the government accountable and uphold your digital rights.

To that aim, EFF’s transparency work is dedicated to using federal and state freedom of information laws, the courtroom, and our megaphone to shine light on government activities.

One of the major tools we use is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a federal law that gives people the right to request information kept by federal government agencies. Our team of FOIA lawyers also submit requests on a variety of digital civil liberties issues and often take cases to court when we believe the government is unduly withholding information. But anyone can make a request under FOIA, and you can go here to learn how you can submit your own.

While emerging technologies give the government new tools that threaten citizen civil liberties, technology also has the potential to create a more democratic relationship between public institutions and the citizens they serve. Today, a broad range of new tools are allowing the public to more closely examine government and corporate entities and to hold them accountable for deception, censorship, and corruption. In addition to using freedom of information laws to shed light on government actions, EFF also wants to highlight technologies that _help_ the transparency process —whether it’s making it easier to file and track FOIA requests, websites dedicated to whistleblowing, or open government initiatives that can improve access to information.





International
=============

EFF's international team advocates for privacy, free speech, and an open Internet in international venues and across the world. We expose mass and unwarranted surveillance, and educate unlawfully targeted users on how to protect themselves and their colleagues. We use individual cases globally to highlight the effect of technology on human rights, and defend technologists from persecution and detention wherever they live.

### Ensuring users' voices are heard in global policymaking

Internet users are impacted not only by rules and policies made in their own country, but those made around the world. EFF's international team fights to make sure that Internet users are heard in these processes. They include copyright treaties developed by the [World Intellectual Property Organization](https://www.eff.org/issues/wipo) (WIPO), trade agreements such as the now-defeated [Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) (TPP), domain name policies developed by [ICANN](https://www.eff.org/issues/icann), and increasingly, a [shadowy web](https://www.eff.org/issues/shadow-regulation) of cross-border industry agreements forged in corporate backrooms.

Where international bodies lack an adequate rights-based framework for their deliberations, EFF also works to fill the gap by developing global principles such as the [Manila Principles for Intermediary Liability](https://www.manilaprinciples.org/) and the [Necessary and Proportionate principles](https://necessaryandproportionate.org/). We use these to promote users' rights on the global stage in bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://www.eff.org/issues/oecd) (OECD) and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).

### Fighting unchecked surveillance laws and norms

We fight [laws and treaties](https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards) that seek to legitimize [mass surveillance](https://www.eff.org/issues/surveillance-human-rights) and weaken civil liberties and transparency. We work to spotlight privacy violations throughout the world and defend against influential governments seeking to increase law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ power. EFF fends off proposals for [mandatory data retention](https://www.eff.org/issues/mandatory-data-retention), wiretapping-friendly legislation, national identity schemes, [biometrics initiatives](https://www.eff.org/issues/biometrics), and invasive location tracking. EFF works with [digital rights organizations](https://www.eff.org/csss) around the globe to fight for privacy, and  pressure telecommunications companies to protect the privacy of their customers.

### Exposing Institutional Censorship

EFF recognizes that much of today’s free expression takes place on corporate platforms, which apply their own rules and are subject to the legal requirements of different jurisdictions. While in recent years most major companies have produced transparency reports that show content takedowns made at the behest of government actors, there is little to no transparency regarding takedowns made on the basis of terms of service. Furthermore, companies often prohibit certain legal content, such as nudity.

We encourage social media companies to operate with greater transparency and accountability. To that end, we partner with Visualizing Impact on [Onlinecensorship.org](https://onlinecensorship.org/), which collects reports from users in an effort to shine a light on content takedowns. We also regularly advocate for companies to make policy changes, particularly when their policies result in discriminatory practices.

### Protecting vulnerable populations from digital attacks

EFF works to protect vulnerable populations from digital attacks. We seek to compensate for the asymmetry between powerful attackers and  targets who do not necessarily have a strong, technical understanding of digital security or a team of experts at their disposal. We research the threats that these populations face, such as [state-sponsored malware](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware).  We raise awareness of digital privacy and security issues through our [Surveillance Self-Defense project](https://ssd.eff.org/) and conduct security trainings based on these materials. We also defend the rights of security researchers through our work on [export controls](https://www.eff.org/issues/export-controls) and EFF's [Coders Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders). so that these researchers can continue to contribute to the safety and security of vulnerable populations.

### Defending Technologists and Censored Voices Across The World

Throughout its history, EFF has defended those who have been unfairly targeted with prosecution and detention simply because they used technology to exercise their civil liberties. With our [Offline project](https://www.eff.org/offline), EFF seeks to highlight the international cases of individuals who have used technology to speak out against abuse, or have built and shared technology that protects or extends human rights, and have been imprisoned as a result. We work with the communities that support these prisoners of conscience, draw attention to their predicament, and work for their release.





Security
========

Computer security and the lack of computer security is a fundamental issue that underpins much of how the Internet does (and doesn't) function. Many of the policy issues that EFF works on are linked to security in deep ways including privacy and anonymity, DRM, censorship, and network neutrality.

EFF works directly on a wide range of security issues including increased deployment of cryptographic protocols through projects like [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/); improving the security of those protocols; offering legal assistance to researchers through our [Coders' Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders); offering practical security advice to activists through the [surveillance self-defense](https://ssd.eff.org) project; and working on the development of new security standards.

How to Fix the Internet: Podcast
================================

It seems like everywhere we turn we see dystopian stories about technology’s impact on our lives and our futures — from tracking-based surveillance capitalism to street level government surveillance to the dominance of a few large platforms choking innovation to the growing pressure by authoritarian governments to control what we see and say — the landscape can feel bleak. Exposing and articulating these problems is important, but so is envisioning and then building a better future. That’s where our podcast comes in.

Collaging, remixing, sampling—art always has been more than the sum of its parts, a synthesis of elements and ideas that produces something new and thought-provoking. Technology has enabled and advanced this enormously, letting us access and manipulate information and images in ways that would’ve been unimaginable just a few decades...

Electronic Frontier Alliance
============================

The Electronic Frontier Alliance is a grassroots network of community and campus organizations across the United States working to educate our neighbors about the importance of digital rights. Participation is open to any group that endorses our simple principles. Read our [FAQ](https://www.eff.org/EFA-FAQ).

## Electronic Frontier Alliance Principles

As a member organization of the EFA, we believe that technology should support the intellectual freedom at the heart of a democratic society. In the digital age, that entails advancing:

##### **1. Free Expression**

People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.

##### **2. Security**

Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.

##### **3. Privacy**

Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own parameters about what to share with whom.

##### **4. Creativity**

Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations, and inventions of others.

##### **5. Access to Knowledge**

Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.

We uphold these principles by fighting for transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.

[Find Allies](https://www.eff.org/electronic-frontier-alliance/allies)

## Are you part of an organization?

If your group supports principles uniting the Electronic Frontier Alliance, share them within your organization and [join the EFA](https://supporters.eff.org/join-the-efa) to connect with allies across the country.

Volunteer
=========

## Coding with EFF

EFF has a team of staff technologists who spend a good portion of their time developing and maintaining software projects designed to defend civil liberties and enhance privacy and security online. We are looking for passionate individuals to volunteer their technological skills to support these software projects, and contribute to EFF's mission. To learn more and to get involved, please see our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page. You can view some of our [Volunteer Technologists](https://www.eff.org/about/volunteer-technologists).

[View](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff)

## Translating with EFF

For information on how to get involved with translations at EFF, check out our [Translating with EFF page](https://www.eff.org/translating-eff).

[View](https://www.eff.org/translating-eff)

## EFF Cooperating Techs Announce List

EFF is often contacted by attorneys or members of the general public who have a need for technical assistance. The Cooperating Techs list is a low volume mailing list that connects these people with technologists who have the expertise and the desire to assist. We will post a note to the list with a basic description of the project or need; if you are qualified and interested, you respond to the call, and we'll connect you to the attorney. EFF won't investigate or vouch for either side so it is up to both parties to negotiate the work arrangements. We'll simply provide the connection.

[Subscribe](https://mail.eff.org/mailman/listinfo/effcooperatingtechs)

## EFF Cooperating Attorneys List

EFF receives many requests for legal assistance. In order to try to find help for as many people as possible, we maintain a post-only email list that attorneys can join called the Cooperating Attorneys list. The list receives anonymized requests for help, both directly on EFF cases and on cases where the EFF cannot offer assistance. If you are an attorney who is interested in joining the list, please contact the Legal Intake Coordinator at [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org) with the subject line, "Cooperating Attorney List Inquiry". More general information about the list can be found on our [Legal Assistance](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance#coopatty) page.

[Subscribe](mailto:info@eff.org?subject=Cooperating Attorney List Inquiry)

## Research with EFF

We are always looking for volunteers to do small research tasks to help build out the [Atlas of Surveillance](https://atlasofsurveillance.org/) dataset. Whether you’ve got 30 minutes or 30 hours to contribute, please sign up using to our list.

## Designing with EFF

EFF has a team of staff designers who create the [stunning artwork](https://www.flickr.com/photos/electronicfrontierfoundation "EFF Flickr page") we use on our sites and in our campaigns. Thanks to the talent we have on staff, we don't generally have much immediate need for volunteer design help, but there are still some ways that artists, designers, photographers and other visual thinkers can contribute.

Designers with expertise in UI and UX may wish to contribute to one of our many open source projects. See our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page, which has information on how to contribute to our [Open Source Design Repository](https://github.com/EFForg/design "EFF design on Github") on Github.

Artists, illustrators, photographers, and poster or meme designers may wish to share their work through the online Commons. We encourage the use of a [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ "CC Attribution License") for visual works; if you can post it to a public online forum, and then alert our design team to its existence, we would be happy to consider using it. We especially appreciate images that reflect all sorts of Internet users in the world; particular projects we are especially inspired by include [WOC in Tech Stock Photos](https://www.wocintechchat.com/blog/wocintechphotos "WOC in Tech") and [Safersisters Gifs](https://medium.com/codingrights/safersisters-online-security-tips-in-gifs-222589166ed8 "Safersisters"). While we cannot promise immediate use of everything you share, we welcome your creative contributions to the Commons, and we feel it is likely that others will value your work as well.

Photographers & Illustrators: we are always looking for good stock images on a [CC-Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) featuring diverse users engaging with technologies. Hands on keyboards, hackers busy coding, [protestors holding up phones](https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-rights-and-black-led-movement-against-police-violence "Digital Rights and the Black-led Movement Against Police Violence"); these are some examples of photographic images we have looked for and found in the online Commons. Positive images of technology's potential are particularly welcome; dystopian images are also great, but easier to find.

Icon and logo designers: images that take a novel approach to representing abstract concepts such as justice, technological freedom, innovation, privacy, censorship, and political activism are particularly useful.

Online forums which enable CC licensing include, but are not limited to: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page); [Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/); [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/commons).

Please do send us a note; we would love to hear from you!

Tools from EFF's Tech Team
==========================

EFF’s team of technologists and computer scientists engineers solutions to the problems of sneaky tracking, inconsistent encryption, and more. Where users face threats to their privacy and security online, EFF’s technology tools are there to defend them.

For those with design, programming, and/or security skills, [volunteering](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) to [dig into the code](https://github.com/EFForg/) is an even more direct way to contribute to these projects.

Other Ways to Give
==================

Show your support and start conversations about online rights with EFF stickers, apparel, and more.

EFF is one of several, carefully selected Human and Civil Rights Organizations across the country that federal, some state and local employees can donate through payroll deductions. We are proud that so many government employees decide to support digital civil liberties as part of the annual Combined Federal Campaign, and would be happy to provide you with more information about how you can contribute, or visit their site at [http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html](http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html).

**EFF’s CFC Code is 10437.**

Even if you’re not a government employee, you can participate by representing EFF at local campaign events and fairs. Please contact Maggie Kazmierczak, EFF’s Membership Coordinator, at maggie@eff.org for training and informational materials to distribute at an event near your hometown.

Many workplaces match their employees’ charitable gifts, meaning EFF will receive anywhere from 50% to 200% in additional contributions, as long as you report the donation to your employer. There are usually three steps to the process:

EFF will take it from there. If you want to help your colleagues, please add a description of the matching gifts procedure at your company and links to any forms available online at [https://eff.org/match](https://www.eff.org/match).

### **Legacy Giving**

Create a Legacy through the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Long-Term Investment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties

There are many ways you can make a significant gift to EFF that will provide you with tax savings and other benefits. Depending upon your unique financial planning objectives, you can be a major supporter of EFF using any or all of the giving methods described below. It is important, regardless of the size of your estate, to have a properly executed plan to ensure that you, not the courts, determine who will receive your property upon your death. When you create a will or living trust with a qualified advisor, attorney, accountant and/or financial planner, you ensure that your intentions are carried out. You are also ensuring that the needs of the people and organizations you care about will be met. The Development Office is prepared to work closely with you and your financial advisors to explain the benefits of each gift category. We encourage you to consult with your tax advisor for specific information about your own estate and financial planning goals.

### Bequests

The amount of a bequest gift is fully deductible for estate tax purposes. Gifts of securities, real property, and business interests may be made as bequests. Some sample language you can use to include EFF in your estate plan: "I bequeath to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, California 94109, the sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ($) dollars for its general purposes."

### Gifts of Life Insurance

By naming EFF the owner and beneficiary of an existing policy, you receive a tax deduction for the cash surrender value. You may also decide to make EFF the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. If you make gifts to EFF in the amount of the policy's premiums, you can take a charitable income tax deduction (provided EFF is not obligated to use the payments to cover the policy's premium).

### Retirement Plans

You can name EFF as a beneficiary of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 401 (k) Plan, 403 (b) Plan, Qualified Pension Plan, or Qualified Profit-Sharing Plan. Transferring these assets to a family member at the death of the plan participant may trigger two potential federal taxes: estate tax and income tax. When a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, the combination of these taxes could consume most of the assets intended for transfer. Since EFF is a tax-exempt organization, we do not have to pay taxes on the income from the plan. Your plan administrator can provide you with a beneficiary form.

### Financial Accounts

By including EFF as a beneficiary of a bank account, brokerage account, mutual fund account, or an asset such as a certificate of deposit (CD), you can provide a legacy gift to support our work. Your estate would receive a charitable deduction equal to the amount of the gift. Simply fill out a beneficiary designation form obtained from the institution holding your account.

### Specific language for a bequest

> Organization name: Electronic Frontier Foundation
>
> Address: 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109
>
> Tax identification number: 04-3091431
>
> Organization type: Nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status
>
> Legal Language: Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, organized and existing under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and with the principal business address of 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109.

### **Hardware Donations**

EFF is always grateful to receive donations of computing equipment and related hardware, which can be of great benefit to our organization's work. However, our needs are specific, and we cannot accept unsolicited equipment.

We are not currently accepting hardware donations. We will update this page as our needs change. Thank you for your interest.

EFF is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization (FEIN 04-3091431) as recognized by the Internal Revenue Service. No goods or services, in whole or in part, were received in exchange for this contribution, therefore, the full fair-market value of your contribution is deductible for income tax purposes in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations.

**[Go to Top](#top)**

### **Organizational Membership**

Donations from businesses and other organizations allow EFF to address challenges to digital freedom wherever we are needed most. While EFF does not endorse private companies or their products, we're grateful for their contributions in support of our digital rights work. [Learn more about organizational membership here.](https://www.eff.org/thanks#organizational_members)

### **Online Purchases: [eBay](http://givingworks.ebay.com/), [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/)**

### **Stock Donations**

A gift of appreciated stock generally offers a twofold tax savings. First, you avoid paying any capital gains tax on the increase in the value of the stock. Second, you receive a charitable income tax deduction for the fair market value of the stock on the date it is transferred. Make sure you have owned the stock for a "long-term" period (more than 12 months) to qualify for these tax advantages. Gifts of appreciated stock are fully deductible--up to a maximum of 30% of your adjusted gross income. Please check with your accountant or tax advisor regarding your particular tax status.

To facilitate the transfer of securities, please use the following information:

- Brokerage Firm: Morgan Stanley
- Account Name: Electronic Frontier Foundation
- Contact: Douglas Ingham: 650-926-7621
- E-mail: Douglas.J.Ingham@morganstanley.com
- EFF Account #: 233-055606-950
- DTC #: 0015
- Tax ID #: 04-3091431

Please let us know in advance if you are transmitting securities via DTC by contacting EFF's Donor Relations Manager Daniel de Zeeuw at ddz@eff.org. You may also find it convenient to email him a copy of the letter of authorization from your broker.

Your support of EFF enables us to continue the fight to defend digital freedom for all. Thank you!

### **Donate Your Time**

EFF relies on financial support from supporters like you, but you can also engage with digital rights issues by becoming a [volunteer](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer) or spreading the word with the [Electronic Frontier Alliance](https://www.eff.org/efa).

Donating to EFF is a wonderful way to pay tribute to people you care for while protecting digital rights. EFF accepts donations as tributes to friends or family through our online form at [eff.org/tribute](https://www.eff.org/tribute). There, you can decide who the donation is in honor of and if you would like to send someone a gift based on your donation. Feel free to email us at [membership@eff.org](mailto:membership@eff.org) or call +1-415-436-9333 x117 if you have any questions.

**I'd like to direct people to donate to EFF in honor of a loved one. How can I set that up?**

If you'd like to set up an online form to allow donations in honor of a loved one or a life event, please email us at membership@eff.org, and we can set up a custom donate page for you. Note that we cannot share information about donors, but we can include information on how donors who visit that page can send you a message about their gift.

**I want to donate to EFF in person. Will you be at an event near me soon?**

## **OTHER WAYS TO GIVE**

**What kinds of donations do you take?**

[You can give through EFF’s online form](https://www.eff.org/donate)— _and even become an official EFF member!_—by using any major credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or cryptocurrency via BitPay. As of this writing, you can use BitPay to donate Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and 5 USD-pegged stablecoins (GUSD, USDC, USDP, DAI, and BUSD).

You can donate by check or money order payable to EFF by using [our mail-in form](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-mail-membership-form). Send it to EFF at 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109 USA.

EFF accepts other types of donations including [stock](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#stock), [car donations](http://eff.careasy.org/home.html), [several cryptocurrencies](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#crypto), [employer matching gifts](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#employee), and [more](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support). If you're interested in donating to EFF another way, or can't find the information you're looking for on this page, please reach out to us at membership@eff.org.

**What information do you need to accept a stock gift?**

Thank you for your interest in donating stock! Please let us know in advance if you are transmitting securities via DTC by contacting EFF's Associate Director of Donor Relations, Nicole Puller via email at nicole@eff.org. Alternatively, you can contact Development Director Aaron Jue at aaron@eff.org. We’ll need to know the amount and type of shares that you will be donating. This is because our broker’s stock confirmation reports include the amount and type of received shares but not details regarding who the donor is. As a result, we’ll know that shares are received but not who they were from. When you reach out to confirm the stock transfer details, it allows us to make sure that you receive a receipt in a timely way. [Find more information here.](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#stock)

**I made a stock gift but never got a receipt. Where is it?**

There are a few possible reasons why you might not have gotten a receipt. We send receipts in the mail, so if we have an outdated mailing address for you in our records, the receipt won’t reach you. Also, we request that donors let us know in advance when they’re making a stock donation. This is because our broker’s stock confirmation reports include the amount and type of received shares but not details regarding the donor. As a result, we’ll know that shares are received but not who they were from. If this applies to you, we would have been unable to issue a receipt until you contact us to confirm what shares were from you. In either case, please reach out to EFF's Associate Director of Donor Relations, Nicole Puller via email at nicole@eff.org, so that she can remedy this for you.

**How can I volunteer?**

## **DONOR POLICY**

**A note to our donors**

Because we seek to represent the public good, and the rights of technology users from all backgrounds, we always act independently from the sources of our funding. That means that donors do not set or influence our agenda or our positions. We believe this is critical not just for EFF, but for our donors, too **_._** [_Read more_](https://www.eff.org/pages/note-our-donors) **_._**

**Gift return policy / Donation return policy**

For information on how to exchange/cancel a gift, please see our [Shop Orders](#shop) section.

If you received a donation premium or product with your contribution, it may be neccessary to return this item during the refund process.

To request a refund or cancel a donation, please email [membership@eff.org](mailto: membership@eff.org) or call +1 (415) 436-9333 x212. Refunds are returned using the original method of payment.

## **OR****GANIZATIONAL MEMBERSHIPS**

**What is an organizational membership?**

Organizational membership is open to any company, private foundation, or organization that donates at least $5,000 per year (or $2,000 per year for organizations with less than $5M revenue per year) and agrees to EFF's org member pledge (below). Membership includes a range of benefits that vary by level. While EFF does not endorse private companies or their products, we're grateful for their contributions. Since we're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the donation is tax deductible.

_Organizational Member Pledge:_ By supporting EFF, we share in EFF’s commitment to help create a world in which technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all the people of the world, without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or age. We also understand that EFF does not endorse private companies or their products or services, regardless of organizational membership status. We will not use the EFF org member badge in any manner that identifies EFF as a “partner,” “sponsor,” or otherwise implies that EFF has endorsed our organization.

**How do I become an organizational member?**

Learn more about the organizational membership program's levels, benefits, and how to donate [here](https://www.eff.org/thanks#organizational_members) [.](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/organizational-donation)

**How are organizational members recognized?**

Organizational member recognition varies by member level, but members that choose to be recognized publicly are included on our org member page, as well as other opportunities including shout outs in our EFFector e-mails, social media platforms, at EFF events, and our annual report. See the [organizational member page](https://www.eff.org/thanks#organizational_members) for logos of current members, as well as member benefits, including recognition. Organizational member links include the rel="nofollow" attribute: We adopted this policy to screen out potential abuse of our program and site to raise the rank of third parties in search algorithms. Unfortunately, this is a growing problem for nonprofits. This was a complex decision since we know many of the sincere supporters behind these companies, but we decided that it was the best choice for us.

**Can my company sponsor an EFF event?**

Thank you for your interest in sponsoring an EFF event! We have several annual events with varying sponsorship opportunities, including [Tech Trivia](https://www.eff.org/event/effs-6th-annual-tech-trivia-night "2022 Tech Trivia announcement"), [Cyberlaw Trivia](https://www.eff.org/event/effs-14th-annual-cyberlaw-trivia-night "2022 Cyberlaw Trivia announcement"), and the [EFF Awards](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/eff-awards-2022-celebration "2022 EFF Awards recap").

Other Ways to Give
==================

Show your support and start conversations about online rights with EFF stickers, apparel, and more.

EFF is one of several, carefully selected Human and Civil Rights Organizations across the country that federal, some state and local employees can donate through payroll deductions. We are proud that so many government employees decide to support digital civil liberties as part of the annual Combined Federal Campaign, and would be happy to provide you with more information about how you can contribute, or visit their site at [http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html](http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html).

**EFF’s CFC Code is 10437.**

Even if you’re not a government employee, you can participate by representing EFF at local campaign events and fairs. Please contact Maggie Kazmierczak, EFF’s Membership Coordinator, at maggie@eff.org for training and informational materials to distribute at an event near your hometown.

Many workplaces match their employees’ charitable gifts, meaning EFF will receive anywhere from 50% to 200% in additional contributions, as long as you report the donation to your employer. There are usually three steps to the process:

EFF will take it from there. If you want to help your colleagues, please add a description of the matching gifts procedure at your company and links to any forms available online at [https://eff.org/match](https://www.eff.org/match).

### **Legacy Giving**

Create a Legacy through the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Long-Term Investment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties

There are many ways you can make a significant gift to EFF that will provide you with tax savings and other benefits. Depending upon your unique financial planning objectives, you can be a major supporter of EFF using any or all of the giving methods described below. It is important, regardless of the size of your estate, to have a properly executed plan to ensure that you, not the courts, determine who will receive your property upon your death. When you create a will or living trust with a qualified advisor, attorney, accountant and/or financial planner, you ensure that your intentions are carried out. You are also ensuring that the needs of the people and organizations you care about will be met. The Development Office is prepared to work closely with you and your financial advisors to explain the benefits of each gift category. We encourage you to consult with your tax advisor for specific information about your own estate and financial planning goals.

### Bequests

The amount of a bequest gift is fully deductible for estate tax purposes. Gifts of securities, real property, and business interests may be made as bequests. Some sample language you can use to include EFF in your estate plan: "I bequeath to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, California 94109, the sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ($) dollars for its general purposes."

### Gifts of Life Insurance

By naming EFF the owner and beneficiary of an existing policy, you receive a tax deduction for the cash surrender value. You may also decide to make EFF the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. If you make gifts to EFF in the amount of the policy's premiums, you can take a charitable income tax deduction (provided EFF is not obligated to use the payments to cover the policy's premium).

### Retirement Plans

You can name EFF as a beneficiary of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 401 (k) Plan, 403 (b) Plan, Qualified Pension Plan, or Qualified Profit-Sharing Plan. Transferring these assets to a family member at the death of the plan participant may trigger two potential federal taxes: estate tax and income tax. When a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, the combination of these taxes could consume most of the assets intended for transfer. Since EFF is a tax-exempt organization, we do not have to pay taxes on the income from the plan. Your plan administrator can provide you with a beneficiary form.

### Financial Accounts

By including EFF as a beneficiary of a bank account, brokerage account, mutual fund account, or an asset such as a certificate of deposit (CD), you can provide a legacy gift to support our work. Your estate would receive a charitable deduction equal to the amount of the gift. Simply fill out a beneficiary designation form obtained from the institution holding your account.

### Specific language for a bequest

> Organization name: Electronic Frontier Foundation
>
> Address: 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109
>
> Tax identification number: 04-3091431
>
> Organization type: Nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status
>
> Legal Language: Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, organized and existing under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and with the principal business address of 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109.

EFF is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization (FEIN 04-3091431) as recognized by the Internal Revenue Service. No goods or services, in whole or in part, were received in exchange for this contribution, therefore, the full fair-market value of your contribution is deductible for income tax purposes in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations.

### **Online Purchases: [eBay](http://givingworks.ebay.com/), [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/)**

### **Stock Donations**

A gift of appreciated stock generally offers a twofold tax savings. First, you avoid paying any capital gains tax on the increase in the value of the stock. Second, you receive a charitable income tax deduction for the fair market value of the stock on the date it is transferred. Make sure you have owned the stock for a "long-term" period (more than 12 months) to qualify for these tax advantages. Gifts of appreciated stock are fully deductible--up to a maximum of 30% of your adjusted gross income. Please check with your accountant or tax advisor regarding your particular tax status.

You do NOT have to ask permission to post original EFF material on a mailing list or newsgroup, to use an EFF logo as a pointer to us on your web site, or to reprint an EFF statement in a newspaper article. **Permission to do such things is explicitly granted.** Please do **not** write to us asking for permission, as this wastes our time and yours.

If you redistribute something you got from the EFF site, it is appreciated if you make it known where the file originated, so people can get more info or updated versions.

## Copyright Infringement Notification

If you believe there is content on the EFF website that violates copyright law, let us know. Specifically, send us an email or letter that includes substantially the following:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
- Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
- A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

The notice should be sent to our designated agent, Corynne McSherry, via email (dmca-notice@eff.org) or fax (415-436-9993).

We may display a copy of your DMCA notice in place of the removed content.

Note: Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages. One company that sent an infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees under this provision. See http://www.eff.org/cases/online-policy-group-v-diebold. In addition, “in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with “a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law,” the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright.” Lenz v. Universal, 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1155 (2008)

EFF reserves the right to review the allegedly infringing material and independently determine whether it is infringing.

Please also note that the information provided in this legal notice will be forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content. A copy of this legal notice may also be sent (with your personal information removed) to a third-party that may publish and/or annotate it for noncommercial research and educational purposes.

## Counter-Notification: What You Can Do If Your Content Was Removed

If you believe material you posted to EFF’s site was not infringing, you can submit a counter-notice. If you need assistance in determining whether the material was not infringing, please contact our Intake Coordinator (via email at info@eff.org), who may be able to help you find an independent attorney to evaluate your situation.

A counter-notification must include the following:

- Identification of the specific URLs of material that EFF has removed or to which EFF has disabled access.
- Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address.
- The statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which EFF is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant." EFF is located in the Northern District of California.
- The statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."

A scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature is fine.

Please send your counter-notice to Corynne McSherry, via email (dmca-notice@eff.org) or fax (415-436-9993)

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. If you are concerned about protecting your anonymity, please consult with an attorney about other options.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 business days that the claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on EFF’s site. If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, generally we will reinstate the material.

Please also be advised that in appropriate circumstances we terminate repeat infringers.





Trademark and Brand Usage Policy
================================

Welcome to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (“EFF”) Trademark and Brand Usage Policy. This policy is designed to answer the most common questions we receive regarding use of our EFF trademarks, to provide our community with clear guidance, and to enable you to make certain uses of our EFF trademarks without the need to seek our individual, written permission in each instance.

EFF has, [on](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/eff-jones-day-dont-be-trademark-bully) [many](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dear-google-parody-not-trademark-infringement) [occasions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/eff-court-trademark-not-censorship-tool), demanded that companies and other organizations tolerate legal, fair uses of their trademarks, including those uses that parody or criticize the organization in question. Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any right you may have to use EFF’s trademarks in a manner that is otherwise allowed by law, including to criticize EFF or to parody our organization or our work.

## What are Trademarks?

Trademarks are best thought of as a type of consumer protection law: they help those seeking goods and services efficiently differentiate one supplier from another. The term “trademark” includes any word, name, symbol, or device – or any combination of those – that is used by a person or entity to identify and distinguish their goods and services from those offered by others, and to indicate the source or origin of their goods and services. So, for example, you can tell if your computer operating system originated in Redmond or in Cupertino by referencing the operating system’s trademark and branding; and neither Microsoft nor Apple can adopt the brands of the other, because such use would typically cause confusion among consumers. In the U.S., and in many other jurisdictions, it is not required to register a trademark with the government before claiming rights in the mark.

## What are EFF Trademarks?

The EFF trademarks (collectively, the “EFF Marks”) are all trademarks owned or used by EFF, including but not limited to:

1. our ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION® trademark
2. our EFF® trademark
3. our PRIVACY BADGER® trademark
4. our CERTBOT® trademark
5. our "EFF Logo" Design trademark

![EFF logo 2018](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/07/10/eff-logo-lockup-black.png)
6. our “EFF Meatball” Design® trademark

![EFF small logo](https://www.eff.org/files/2017/09/07/meatball.png)
7. our “Certbot” Design trademark

![certbot logo](https://www.eff.org/files/2017/09/07/certbot.png)

This list may be updated as other trademarks are created or registered.

Consistent with our position favoring the free exchange of ideas and information, and favoring limitations on the ability of trademark owners to stifle speech with which they disagree, nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights you may have to use EFF’s Marks in a manner that is otherwise allowed by law.

For example, trademark law (including pursuant to the “nominative fair use” doctrine) allows you to make non-trademark use of the EFF Marks to truthfully refer to or identify the EFF and its products and services. So, you don’t need our permission to write about why you love (or hate) our advocacy work, to inform others of the origin of our Certbot software, or the like.

Your intended use may be a nominative fair use if:

1.  it’s not easy to identify the product or company without using a mark (e.g., using the term “Chicago Bulls” instead of “the basketball team that plays in Chicago” is acceptable);
2. only so much is used as is necessary to identify the product or company and to accomplish your purpose; and
3. you do nothing to suggest the mark-owner has endorsed or sponsored your use.

_Personal, Non-Commercial Uses on Affinity Products_

You may use the EFF Marks without asking our permission on products like t-shirts and stickers that express your affinity for our organization, provided that: (1) your use is non-commercial in nature and you give the products away for free; (2) your use is not misleading and not likely to cause confusion as to whether EFF sponsored, endorsed, or was otherwise involved in creating or offering your products; and (3) if you are offering more than 50 units, you do not advertise or offer the products online.

If you want to sell affinity products (even if you’re just charging a nominal fee to cover your costs), want to give away more than 50 units online, or want to make any other uses not specifically permitted here, you must obtain our written permission first.

## In Which Situations May I NOT Use the EFF Marks?

In any situation not specifically listed above, and where you are not otherwise legally permitted to do so, you must ask us for permission before using our trademarks. For example, you may not use our EFF Marks in the following situations:

_Uses that are Confusing, False, or Misleading_

You may not use any EFF Mark in a manner that is false or misleading, or in a manner likely to confuse consumers or the public about the source or origin of your products or services. Confusing uses include uses that may cause people to think your products or services are EFF’s products or services, or vice versa, or that may imply a formal affiliation between you and EFF where none exists. Unless we have done so in writing, EFF has not officially sponsored or endorsed your product or service, and you should not imply that we have.

You may not use the EFF Marks in, or as a part of, any trade name, trademark, domain name, or internet account name that is likely to cause confusion. So, the business name or trademark “EFF Activist Tool,” or the Twitter handle “@EFFActivistTool,” are not permitted, because folks who see those uses are likely to assume that they are official EFF services or accounts, or to assume that their owner is officially sponsored or endorsed by EFF. By the same token, the domain name “EFF-Activist-Tools.com,” or the Facebook group “EFF Activist Tools,” would also be likely to cause confusion.

That said, the purpose of trademark law is to address confusion, and uses that misleadingly suggest affiliation where none exists: not to silence legitimate criticism, commentary, or parody. For example, if you were to use an @EFF\_sucks Twitter account to voice criticism of our organization, that is probably not something the public would view as an official EFF account, and no permission would be required for a use of that nature.

## Uses of EFF Marks in Connection with Derivative Software

EFF offers a few software products to the community on a free and open source basis (our “Open Source Products”), which means that you can alter and modify the source code of e.g., our Certbot project to better suit your needs. We encourage you to do so! And, nothing in this policy is intended to limit your ability to tinker with, improve, and modify our open source software in any manner.

However, from a trademark point of view, software that you have modified is different from the software that originates from EFF, and you may not brand any derivative software with an EFF Mark, even if you make only minor changes to it, except as provided below (repackaging). For example, if you modify our Certbot software, you are free to distribute that modification broadly, but you may not distribute the Derivative Software under the Certbot brand, or under any brand that is confusingly similar to “Certbot” or to any other EFF Mark, unless your modification constitutes a repackaging as defined below. For example, use of “Certbot for Plan 9” or “EFF Certbot Fork” as trademarks or in advertising your Derivative Software is otherwise expressly prohibited.

You can, however, use the EFF Marks to truthfully describe your own products or services in a descriptive, non-trademark sense. For example, if you offer a software product that adds features to one of our Open Source Products, you may use an EFF trademark like “Certbot” to describe the fact that your software is based on Certbot. So, statements like “based on Certbot,” “forked from Certbot,” or “derived from Certbot,” would be permitted to the extent they’re accurate. However, using EFF’s logos or designs, or otherwise making a trademark-type use of the EFF Marks would not be permitted.

If you produce a plugin that is compatible with one of our Open Source Products, you may use the Open Source Product’s trademark as part of the filename for your plugin, though we ask that you also include your own name in the filename (for example, “certbot-yournamehere-s3front”), to avoid confusion with official EFF plugins. We also ask that you provide appropriate attribution to EFF as the source of the original Open Source Product in any NOTICE, README, LICENSE, or similar file in your distribution, and as appropriate elsewhere in your source code.

## Uses of EFF Marks in Connection with New Software Packages

“Packaging” software, or creating a new software package, refers to the process of modifying the original source code of software solely for the purpose of enabling that software to function in a different operating system environment (e.g., modifying its libraries, dependencies, etc.), made without modifying the functionality and/or objectives of the original software product. As noted above, you are generally not permitted to use our EFF Marks in connection with software derived from our Open Source Products. But, if you are only creating a new package of an Open Source Product, like Certbot or Privacy Badger, for use on a particular operating system, we grant you permission to use the Marks, provided that you do each of the following:

1. You may use the mark only when packaging the particular Open Source Product it refers to. For example, if you are creating a Certbot package for a new operating system, you may use only the Certbot trademark in connection with that package; nothing in this section is intended to give you additional rights or licenses to use the EFF word mark or the “EFF Meatball” Design.
2. You may only use the word mark (e.g., Certbot) and not any design marks, logos, or the like, that may be associated with the Open Source Product you are packaging. For example, you may not use our Certbot Design trademark, shown above, in connection with packaging Certbot software.
3. You may use the mark only in connection with packaging an Open Source Product for use with the particular operating system specified in your request (as explained below), and only where you are making no significant or functional change to the software. If you’d like to make significant or functional changes to the software, and would like to offer your software under an EFF Mark, please contact us, as described below ( _see What If I Want Permission For A Use Not Allowed By This Policy?_). This process allows us to work with developers who are planning new features and ensures we can catch any quality, security or compatibility issues that may arise from planned functional changes.
4. Any package you create using an EFF Mark must be of high quality, and in particular must meet any standards of quality that we establish, and as we may change from time to time. We reserve the right to request changes if your software deviates from our quality standards, and your continued use of all EFF Marks is expressly conditioned on your prompt implementation of such changes.
5. EFF has the right to audit any software whose trademark you use pursuant to the permission granted in this section. In particular, upon EFF’s request you must provide us with a link to the project source code e.g., at GitHub, and/or any advertising associated with the product, so that we can audit it periodically to ensure its quality, compatibility with the upstream version, etc. If you decide to cease active development of your package, you agree to let us know about that too. Please keep us updated on the status of your package going forward, and let us know if the person maintaining the project changes.
6. Consistent with the other elements of this policy, please don’t do anything to imply a greater level of sponsorship by or affiliation with EFF than actually exists.
7. Before using any EFF Mark in connection with any package, we ask that you please first contact EFF at packaging\[@\]eff.org to provide (1) the name of the software you are packaging, and the operating system(s) you are packaging it for; (2) your contact information; (3) a link to your project’s source code and, if you have one, project website; and (4) a description of how you intend to use the EFF Marks in connection with your package. This is requested, **but not required** if you are simply using the EFF software as is, or if you are using your own name for your software project, and only using the EFF Mark to to truthfully describe your own products or services in a descriptive, non-trademark sense (i.e. statements like “based on Certbot” or “forked from Certbot”).  Even when we require advance notice, you need not wait for a response from us before starting to use the EFF Mark in connection with your project, but as noted above we reserve the right to control the quality of projects that use an EFF Mark, so we may follow up with specific requests.  To be clear, this policy is simply about ensuring that software named with an EFF Mark meets high quality standards, it does not require you to do anything to take advantage of our open software licenses under your own branding.

Repackagers help us get our products out to as many people as possible, and we value your service to the community. Thank you!

## What If I Want Permission For A Use Not Allowed By This Policy?

If you wish to use any of the EFF Marks in a manner that is not expressly permitted by this policy, or otherwise permitted by a trademark law exception such as fair use, please contact us directly at info\[at\]eff.org. We will be happy to consider your request. For most efficient processing of your request, your email should:

1. provide plenty of detail regarding the requested use (e.g., “I’d like to sell 100 hoodies at an upcoming technology meetup occurring on April 5, 2063”);
2. contain a mockup of the use you plan to make, so that we can review it (e.g., “enclosed is a .png version of the design that I’d like to use on the back of the hoodies I plan to offer”);
3. be clear as to timing and when you require approval (e.g., “I need to order the garments no later than February 5, 2063”); and
4.  let us know whether the goods you plan to produce will be given away for free, or how you anticipate pricing them, if applicable.

We ask that you submit any such requests to us at least four (4) weeks before you require approval.

If you plan to make a profit on your use – for example, if you’ll be charging more for your hoodies than they cost to produce – we’ll likely ask you to agree to donate any profits you end up with (if any) to EFF.

## If I Have Permission to Use an EFF Mark, What Are the Usage Restrictions for That Trademark?

Use the Exact Mark. EFF’s trademarks should be used in their exact, most up-to-date form. They should neither be abbreviated nor combined with other words.

Mark the Mark. The first or most prominent use of an EFF Mark should be accompanied by a “tm” symbol (“™”), to indicate that it is a trademark; you may also use the “r in a circle” symbol (“®”), if the trademark in question is a registered trademark. If you aren’t sure, using the “tm” symbol (“™”) is fine. The first or most prominent mention of an EFF Mark should also be set apart from surrounding text, either by capitalizing, italicizing, bolding, or underlining it.

Credit the Mark. The following notice text should appear somewhere nearby your first or most prominent mention of an EFF Mark (for example in a footer). If that’s not practical, you may include it in a reasonable alternate location:

_\[mark\] is a trademark of the Electronic Frontier Foundation._

Any goodwill generated by use of the EFF Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of EFF.

## How Do I Report Trademark Abuse?

Please report any misuse of the EFF Marks to info\[at\]eff.org, and provide us with as much information as you can about the use you think might be infringing. We’ll investigate the use, and take appropriate action, if warranted.

## Questions?

If you’d like to use the EFF Marks in a way that’s not covered by this policy, or if you have any questions regarding this policy or the use of our trademarks overall, please contact us at info\[at\]eff.org. Please note that it may take **four (4) weeks** for such requests to be processed.





Privacy Policy
==============

(Note that EFF's Technology Projects, such as HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Badger, and Certbot, have a different privacy policy, available [here](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy/policy))

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and volunteers. EFF has established this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our websites and how it is used, as well as protections for our members’ and donors’ personal information.

In this policy, "EFF" refers to EFF staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep confidential information they receive as part of their assistance to EFF.

EFF does not sell or rent member, donor or website visitor information under any circumstances, and we do not share member, donor or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law. This restriction applies to member and donors who join or donate both online and offline. (See discussion below.)

EFF is located within the United States, and therefore will transfer, process, and store your information in the United States, which may not provide as much protection as your home country. (We’re [working](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) to make US practices better.)

## Information Gathered by EFF's Site

**Logging:** For visitors to our website, we generally log only timestamps, URLs, and HTTP requests and do internal analytical logging, including additional technical information such as a single byte from IP addresses (described [further below](https://www.eff.org/policy#analytics)), for up to seven days from when the data was collected.

Circumstances in which EFF may need to log and retain technical information for longer than seven days include when we believe it is reasonably necessary for EFF’s mission and functionality, including situations such as:

- site testing,

- diagnosis of technical problems,

- defending against attacks to the site,

- handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal, short-term circumstances, or

- research projects (in anonymized form) that serve our overall mission to defend freedom online.

In those and similar situations we will delete the information as soon as it is apparent that the information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was retained. For more information on EFF's position on data logging and techniques we use to anonymize, obfuscate, aggregate and delete information, see our [Best Practices for Online Service Providers](https://www.eff.org/wp/osp).

**How EFF Internal Analytics Works:** EFF endeavors to gather sufficient information for analyzing our website and how visitors move within it without compromising the privacy of our visitors.  EFF’s internal analytical logging involves logging for up to seven days a single byte of the IP address, as well as the referrer page, time stamp, page requested, user agent, language header, website visited, and a hash of all of this information. After seven days we keep only aggregate information from these logs. We also geolocate IP addresses before anonymizing them and store only the country.

**Cookies:** We do not use persistent ID cookies on this site except where you click “remember me” or are logged in, as you can be for the Action Center. We use session cookies on certain portions of the website. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. You can use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) if you wish to keep your connection information anonymous, but please note that you can still be identified to EFF if you log in.

**Voluntarily Submitted Information:** In addition, EFF collects and retains information you voluntarily submit to us. It is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much information to provide. If you choose to become an EFF member, use the EFF Shop, otherwise donate to EFF or use our Action Center, we may ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, mailing address and phone number and will retain that information. For online donors and shoppers, we also ask for your credit card number or other payment information. For the Action Center, we maintain aggregate information about participation in the action campaigns, and, if you agree, we will also maintain account-specific records of your use of the Action Center. If you use the EFF Shop, you are asked to provide personal information, such as a shipping address, necessary to complete your transaction.

We may ask for additional personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or otherwise communicate with us. We are pleased to receive anonymous donations in the mail or in-person, but please note that your personal information may be required if you choose to donate using our online form, or if you choose to use a mobile payment processor for in-person donations (and the mobile payment processor will also receive your payment information, subject to their privacy policy.)

From time to time, we may ask for personal information on other portions of the site, such as asking you to sign a petition, participate in a contest, or provide prior art for a patent busting project.

**EFFector and other Mailing Lists:** If you choose to subscribe to EFFector, our free electronic newsletter or any of our other mailing lists, we collect your email address, and, if you choose to provide it, a zip or postal code.

## EFF's Use of Information

In general, EFF uses the information provided by you to further its mission, including to protect privacy, defend freedom and innovation, and to protect your rights in the digital world **.**

**Member and Donor Information:** We use member and donor information for our legitimate interest in processing and managing your membership or contribution, including fundraising reminders and renewals. If you agree, we will use your email address to send you updates and alerts on protecting your rights in the digital world, so you may take action, such as contacting your representative in Congress or attending an event. If you choose to complete the "Please tell us why you became a member of EFF" field when donating, this information may be shared with the entire EFF staff and board, and select unattributed quotes may be used to promote our mission, such as including a relevant quote in a grant proposal.

Action Center: We use the information you supply in our Action Center to help you take action in support of digital civil liberties, such as contacting decision makers (e.g. a representative in Congress) and their staff, signing a petition or sharing a message on social media. We may use Action Center information to assess the success of action campaigns and to improve the functionality and effectiveness of our site, and to allow you to see records of your activities.We, and our coalition partners, may publicize and share aggregate information about action campaigns, such as the number of people who participated in a particular location or region or through a type of action, as well as sharing or publicizing activity trends.

**Publication by EFF:** If you provide information for publication we may use your name and contact information you have provided to us to provide you with attribution.

**Other activities:** We may run surveys, contests, or similar activities through this site. Such information will be used for the purposes for which it was collected. We use the information provided through our online shop to fulfill your order, and address any problems that might arise. We also look at technical information to diagnose problems with or consider improvements to our servers or related technologies and to administer eff.org and other websites we host or provide.

## Third-Party Service Providers to EFF

Portions of the eff.org site, including some of our individual action alert webpages, are operated by third-parties, such as grassroots campaign service providers. When necessary and appropriate, EFF uses the following categories of third party services:

- content delivery networks and cloud hosting providers (for example, hosting and handling traffic to our site).

- Financial services and payment processors (for example, your credit card and online payments)

- cloud email providers (for example, sending you email, like the EFFector newsletter)

- shipping and fulfillment services (for example, shipping you our [great swag](https://supporters.eff.org/shop))


Where possible, we take steps to limit the ability of third parties to retain data about our users. These service providers may place session cookies on your computer. EFF’s service providers may also log standard technical information, such as the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. Our service providers may also store and organize the personal information collected through this site on our behalf. EFF’s third party providers primarily process information in the United States, but may process data in other jurisdictions. Where applicable, we have entered into [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR) compliant Data Protection Addendums with third-parties who process data on our behalf.

In addition, for all of EFF's service providers, hosting providers and credit card processors and any other providers we may use in the future, the information collected from EFF users remains protected by the terms of our agreements with those providers and we will ensure that the information to be kept confidential and disclosed only to employees who require such access in the course of their assigned duties. EFF also requires all of our third-party service providers to notify EFF if they receive legal process seeking information about visitors to EFF’s website.

EFF may change the specific third-party providers from time to time, and will transfer stored information to any new provider subject to similar restrictions and agreements. From time to time, EFF may work with third-party consultants or other service providers who may have access to personally identifiable information. In such cases, we will restrict their use of personally identifiable information in accordance with their assigned tasks.

## Third-Party Services and APIs

EFF’s site also provides links to or interacts with a wide variety of third-party websites, including interactive links to sites like social media, telephone calling services, mapping services, or video hosting websites, often via application programming interfaces ( [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api)). EFF is not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties.

We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited via links from or interactions with the EFF website. Where appropriate, we will provide specific notice of these third-party services at the point of interaction. It is our policy not to include third-party resources when users initially load our web pages, but we may dynamically include them later after giving the user a chance to choose to interact with them. If you believe a third-party resource is automatically loading, please let us know so we can address it.

## Disclosure of Your Information

While EFF endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper and we have done so.

## Updating or Removing Your Information

You may choose to correct, update, access, or delete the membership information you have submitted to us by sending an email requesting changes to membership@eff.org. If you join the Action Center, you may correct, update, access, or delete the information provided on the account management page.

Your consent to our use of your information is very important to us. If you would like to withdraw your consent to receive the EFFector newsletter, Action Alerts and other bulk emails, you may use this [subscription management page](https://supporters.eff.org/account) to unsubscribe. If you would like to otherwise withdraw your consent, restrict or object to EFF’s processing of your data, please email [privacypolicy@eff.org](mailto:privacypolicy@eff.org).

## Data Storage and Retention

EFF’s server logs are stored and retained as explained above in the section on logging.

Information submitted through our Action Center, including records of the actions you take, is retained until you choose to delete your account. Email subscriptions information is retained until you unsubscribe from the mailing list(s).

If you communicate with EFF, such as through [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org), we keep records of those communications indefinitely, pursuant to our document retention policy (described below).

Financial records of donations and other transactions are retained indefinitely, pursuant to our document retention policy. Paper records of donations, such as event donation forms and signup sheets, are typically destroyed soon after entry. Check copies and payment distribution details are normally kept up to seven years. Accompanying donor information is kept indefinitely unless the individual requests that it be removed.

Our document retention policy provides that EFF generally retains documents for the period of their immediate or current use, unless longer retention is necessary to comply with contractual or legal requirements. However, data storage periods are based on EFF's assessment of its needs and might include retaining some documents for historical reference and retaining some documents because EFF has insufficient organizational resources available to dedicate to their review and destruction, and/or other pertinent factors.

If we inadvertently collect more personal information than intended, we endeavor to delete the extraneous information. When we no longer need to retain information or when deleting information on request, we endeavor to remove all copies. However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media.

## Contacting EFF

If you have any questions about our privacy and data protection practices, you can reach EFF at:

Electronic Frontier Foundation

815 Eddy Street

San Francisco, CA 94109 USA

Phone: +1-415-436-9333

Fax: +1-415-436-9993

Email: [privacypolicy@eff.org](mailto:privacypolicy@eff.org).

If our processing of your personal data is covered by EU law, you may also lodge a complaint with the relevant [data protection supervisory authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm) for your country of residence.

## Security

EFF employs industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, such as the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, data backup systems, and engaging security professionals to evaluate our systems effectiveness. EFF has turned on [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) by default.

Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by EFF in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.

## Changes to Our Policies

EFF's Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with EFF's mission. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will place notice in EFFector and post notice of changes on this page.

_Updated July 1, 2022 to reflect that EFF no longer uses_ [_Cryptolog_](https://github.com/efforg/cryptolog) _, which allowed us to take the IP address portion of the request getting logged and encrypt it, as well as a chunk of random data (the salt), using a cryptographic hash function. Instead, as described above, we generally don’t log IP_ _addresses_ _at all._

_Updated May 25, 2018 to provide more transparency about our privacy practices and more detailed information about how you can access, correct and remove personal data stored with EFF._

_Updated February 20, 2018 to clarify how EFF works with third parties like content delivery networks and cloud service providers._

_Updated July 14, 2016 to clarify the use of information in the EFF Action Center and protections for members who join EFF offline._

_Updated_ _April 7, 2015 to reflect: 1) changes to the types of third-party service providers which may be used by EFF websites; 2) that third-party service providers may be used by any EFF site, not just those on the eff.org domain; and 3) to fix some typographical errors._

_Updated_ _June 12, 2014 to reflect: 1) changes to reflect EFF’s new Action Center, including the consequences for logging in or clicking “remember me,” the identifying information we retain about logged in users and how to manage your account; 2) information use by purchasers in our Shop; 3) a specific section addressing EFF’s use of Third Party Services and API’s._

_Also recently updated May 1, 2014 to reflect: 1) introduction of EFF's separate Technology Projects Privacy Policy; 2) specifying that we will try to give prior notice to users when someone seeks their data from us and that we have actually challenged requests for access to our user information; 3) clarifying that we will ensure that information we give to third parties is protected, even if that is not through a specific agreement (it may, for example, be because the third party does not engage in logging)._

EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.

Even in the fledgling days of the Internet, EFF understood that protecting access to technology was central to advancing freedom for all. In the years that followed, EFF used our fiercely independent voice to clear the way for open source software, encryption, security research, file sharing tools, and a world of emerging technologies.

Today, EFF uses the unique expertise of leading technologists, activists, and attorneys in our efforts to defend free speech online, fight illegal surveillance, advocate for users and innovators, and support freedom-enhancing technologies.

Together, we forged a vast network of concerned members and partner organizations spanning the globe. EFF advises policymakers and educates the press and the public through comprehensive analysis, educational guides, activist workshops, and more. EFF empowers hundreds of thousands of individuals through our [Action Center](https://act.eff.org/ "EFF Action Center") and has become a leading voice in online rights debates.

leez, a second-person narrative. You're quite fond of freely-modifiable and redistributable things.

Free Speech
===========

The online world offers the promise of speech with minimal barriers and without borders. New technologies and widespread internet access have radically enhanced our ability to express ourselves; criticize those in power; gather and report the news; and make, adapt, and share creative works. Vulnerable communities have also found space to safely meet,  grow, and make themselves heard without being drowned out by the powerful. The ability to freely exchange ideas also benefits innovators, who can use all of their capabilities to build even better tools for their communities and the world.

In the U.S., the First Amendment grants individuals the right to speak without government interference. And globally, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protects the right to speak both online and offline. Everyone should be able to take advantage of this promise. And no government should have the power to decide who gets to speak and who doesn’t.

Government threats to online speakers are significant. Laws and policies have enabled censorship regimes, controlled access to information, increased government surveillance, and minimized user security and safety.

At the same time, online speakers’ reliance on private companies that facilitate their speech has grown considerably. Online services’ content moderation decisions have far-reaching impacts on speakers around the world. This includes social media platforms and online sites selectively enforcing their Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and similar rules to censor dissenting voices and contentious ideas. That’s why these services must ground their moderation decisions in human rights and due process principles.

As the law and technology develops alongside our ever-evolving world, it’s important that these neither create nor reinforce obstacles to people’s ability to speak, organize, and advocate for change. Both the law and technology must enhance people’s ability to speak. That’s why EFF fights to protect free speech - because everyone has the right to share ideas and experiences safely, especially when we disagree.





Privacy
=======

New technologies are radically advancing our freedoms, but they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of privacy. National and international laws have yet to catch up with the evolving need for privacy that comes with new digital technologies. Respect for individuals' autonomy, anonymous speech, and the right to free association must be balanced against legitimate concerns like law enforcement. EFF fights in the courts and Congress to maintain your privacy rights in the digital world, and works with partners around the globe to support the development of privacy-protecting technologies.

Your cell phone helps you keep in touch with friends and family, but it also makes it easier for the government to track your location.

Your Web searches about sensitive medical information might seem a secret between you and your search engine, but companies like Google are creating a treasure trove of personal information by logging your online activities, and making it potentially available to any party wielding enough cash or a subpoena.

And the next time you try to board a plane, watch out—you might be turned away after being mistakenly placed on a government watch list, or be forced to open your email in the security line.

Several governments have also chosen to use malware to engage in extra-legal spying or system sabotage for dissidents or non-citizens, all in the name of “national security.”

As privacy needs evolve, so too should our regulatory regimes. National governments must put legal checks in place to prevent abuse of state powers, and international bodies need to consider how a changing technological environment shapes security agencies’ best practices. Above all, we need to respect the rights of autonomy, anonymity, association, and expression that privacy makes possible, while also taking into account legitimate law enforcement concerns.

Read our work on privacy issues below, and join EFF to help support our efforts.

Creativity & Innovation
=======================

Our digital future depends on our ability to access, use, and build on technology. A few media or political interests shouldn’t have unfair technological or legal advantages over the rest of us. Unfortunately, litigious copyright and patent owners can abuse the law to inhibit fair use and stifle competition. Internet service providers can give established content companies an advantage over startups and veto the choices you make in how to use the Internet. The Electronic Frontier Foundation fights against these unfair practices and defends digital creators, inventors, and ordinary technology users. We work to protect and strengthen fair use, innovation, open access, net neutrality, and your freedom to tinker.

In principle, intellectual property laws (or IP law, a [catchall term](https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/the-term "Intellectual Property: The Term") for copyright, patents, and trademarks) should serve the public in a number of ways. Copyrights provide economic incentives for authors and artists to create and distribute new expressive works. Patents reward inventors for sharing new inventions with the public, granting them a temporary and limited monopoly on them in return for contributing to the public body of knowledge. Trademarks help protect customers by encouraging companies to make sure products match the quality standards the public expects.

Unfortunately, our IP regimes have strayed far from their original purposes. Too often, protections for free speech and innovation are seemingly forgotten as soon as someone cries “infringement.” An unproven allegation that your video or blog post infringes copyright, or that your domain name infringes someone’s trademark, can be enough to shut down perfectly lawful speech. A patent troll can kill a small company with a bogus lawsuit based on a questionable patent that shouldn’t have been issued in the first place.

Some of these laws simply haven’t adapted well to modern technology. A warped development in copyright law has made it illegal in many countries to modify or even look at the software built into the products you own, even if you’re doing it for completely lawful purposes. Copyright’s legal reinforcement of digital locks, paired with extreme criminal penalties for infringement, has intimidated a generation of would-be researchers, tinkerers, and inventors. And ongoing expansions of copyright law are often decided in secret, closed-door meetings before the public is ever allowed to debate them

Imbalanced copyright law—and overzealous enforcement—generally favors powerful voices that have a great deal of influence in culture. Extreme copyright laws can intimidate new types of creators, especially those who use new media techniques to criticize dominant culture or powerful entities. Online platforms that support new, independent creators can only thrive when they don’t risk severe legal repercussions for their users’ activities. Similarly, when only the most privileged members of society have access to up-to-date research, only those members can build on that research to create new ideas and inventions. That’s why EFF supports open access to research, so everyone can build on and contribute to our knowledge commons.

Just as new voices can’t thrive if copyright law doesn’t recognize their rights, new players must also have access to the same resources as established ones. When Internet service providers can give preferential treatment to certain content or hardware companies, those technologies harden to the accelerating effect of competition and users can’t access new sources of information and innovative new services. EFF believes that Internet users should have the freedom to use technology however they like without service providers artificially restricting their experience.

Whether we’re fighting patent trolls in court; arguing in Congress for more balanced copyright laws; or urging governments, funders, and educational institutions to adopt open access policies, EFF is committed to building a society that supports creativity and innovation, where established players in the marketplace for technology and culture aren’t allowed to silence the next generation of creators.





Transparency
============

Knowing “what the government is up to” is often the first step in ensuring that the government respects the civil liberties of its citizens. Transparency is especially important given the government’s increasingly secretive use of new technologies for law enforcement and national security purposes. From cell phone location tracking, the use of surveillance drones, secret interpretations of electronic surveillance law, and the expanding use of biometrics, EFF wants to hold the government accountable and uphold your digital rights.

To that aim, EFF’s transparency work is dedicated to using federal and state freedom of information laws, the courtroom, and our megaphone to shine light on government activities.

One of the major tools we use is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a federal law that gives people the right to request information kept by federal government agencies. Our team of FOIA lawyers also submit requests on a variety of digital civil liberties issues and often take cases to court when we believe the government is unduly withholding information. But anyone can make a request under FOIA, and you can go here to learn how you can submit your own.

While emerging technologies give the government new tools that threaten citizen civil liberties, technology also has the potential to create a more democratic relationship between public institutions and the citizens they serve. Today, a broad range of new tools are allowing the public to more closely examine government and corporate entities and to hold them accountable for deception, censorship, and corruption. In addition to using freedom of information laws to shed light on government actions, EFF also wants to highlight technologies that _help_ the transparency process —whether it’s making it easier to file and track FOIA requests, websites dedicated to whistleblowing, or open government initiatives that can improve access to information.





International
=============

EFF's international team advocates for privacy, free speech, and an open Internet in international venues and across the world. We expose mass and unwarranted surveillance, and educate unlawfully targeted users on how to protect themselves and their colleagues. We use individual cases globally to highlight the effect of technology on human rights, and defend technologists from persecution and detention wherever they live.

### Ensuring users' voices are heard in global policymaking

Internet users are impacted not only by rules and policies made in their own country, but those made around the world. EFF's international team fights to make sure that Internet users are heard in these processes. They include copyright treaties developed by the [World Intellectual Property Organization](https://www.eff.org/issues/wipo) (WIPO), trade agreements such as the now-defeated [Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) (TPP), domain name policies developed by [ICANN](https://www.eff.org/issues/icann), and increasingly, a [shadowy web](https://www.eff.org/issues/shadow-regulation) of cross-border industry agreements forged in corporate backrooms.

Where international bodies lack an adequate rights-based framework for their deliberations, EFF also works to fill the gap by developing global principles such as the [Manila Principles for Intermediary Liability](https://www.manilaprinciples.org/) and the [Necessary and Proportionate principles](https://necessaryandproportionate.org/). We use these to promote users' rights on the global stage in bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://www.eff.org/issues/oecd) (OECD) and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).

### Fighting unchecked surveillance laws and norms

We fight [laws and treaties](https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards) that seek to legitimize [mass surveillance](https://www.eff.org/issues/surveillance-human-rights) and weaken civil liberties and transparency. We work to spotlight privacy violations throughout the world and defend against influential governments seeking to increase law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ power. EFF fends off proposals for [mandatory data retention](https://www.eff.org/issues/mandatory-data-retention), wiretapping-friendly legislation, national identity schemes, [biometrics initiatives](https://www.eff.org/issues/biometrics), and invasive location tracking. EFF works with [digital rights organizations](https://www.eff.org/csss) around the globe to fight for privacy, and  pressure telecommunications companies to protect the privacy of their customers.

### Exposing Institutional Censorship

EFF recognizes that much of today’s free expression takes place on corporate platforms, which apply their own rules and are subject to the legal requirements of different jurisdictions. While in recent years most major companies have produced transparency reports that show content takedowns made at the behest of government actors, there is little to no transparency regarding takedowns made on the basis of terms of service. Furthermore, companies often prohibit certain legal content, such as nudity.

We encourage social media companies to operate with greater transparency and accountability. To that end, we partner with Visualizing Impact on [Onlinecensorship.org](https://onlinecensorship.org/), which collects reports from users in an effort to shine a light on content takedowns. We also regularly advocate for companies to make policy changes, particularly when their policies result in discriminatory practices.

### Protecting vulnerable populations from digital attacks

EFF works to protect vulnerable populations from digital attacks. We seek to compensate for the asymmetry between powerful attackers and  targets who do not necessarily have a strong, technical understanding of digital security or a team of experts at their disposal. We research the threats that these populations face, such as [state-sponsored malware](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware).  We raise awareness of digital privacy and security issues through our [Surveillance Self-Defense project](https://ssd.eff.org/) and conduct security trainings based on these materials. We also defend the rights of security researchers through our work on [export controls](https://www.eff.org/issues/export-controls) and EFF's [Coders Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders). so that these researchers can continue to contribute to the safety and security of vulnerable populations.

### Defending Technologists and Censored Voices Across The World

Throughout its history, EFF has defended those who have been unfairly targeted with prosecution and detention simply because they used technology to exercise their civil liberties. With our [Offline project](https://www.eff.org/offline), EFF seeks to highlight the international cases of individuals who have used technology to speak out against abuse, or have built and shared technology that protects or extends human rights, and have been imprisoned as a result. We work with the communities that support these prisoners of conscience, draw attention to their predicament, and work for their release.





Security
========

Computer security and the lack of computer security is a fundamental issue that underpins much of how the Internet does (and doesn't) function. Many of the policy issues that EFF works on are linked to security in deep ways including privacy and anonymity, DRM, censorship, and network neutrality.

EFF works directly on a wide range of security issues including increased deployment of cryptographic protocols through projects like [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/); improving the security of those protocols; offering legal assistance to researchers through our [Coders' Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders); offering practical security advice to activists through the [surveillance self-defense](https://ssd.eff.org) project; and working on the development of new security standards.

How to Fix the Internet: Podcast
================================

It seems like everywhere we turn we see dystopian stories about technology’s impact on our lives and our futures — from tracking-based surveillance capitalism to street level government surveillance to the dominance of a few large platforms choking innovation to the growing pressure by authoritarian governments to control what we see and say — the landscape can feel bleak. Exposing and articulating these problems is important, but so is envisioning and then building a better future. That’s where our podcast comes in.

Electronic Frontier Alliance
============================

The Electronic Frontier Alliance is a grassroots network of community and campus organizations across the United States working to educate our neighbors about the importance of digital rights. Participation is open to any group that endorses our simple principles. Read our [FAQ](https://www.eff.org/EFA-FAQ).

## Electronic Frontier Alliance Principles

As a member organization of the EFA, we believe that technology should support the intellectual freedom at the heart of a democratic society. In the digital age, that entails advancing:

##### **1. Free Expression**

People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.

##### **2. Security**

Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.

##### **3. Privacy**

Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own parameters about what to share with whom.

##### **4. Creativity**

Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations, and inventions of others.

##### **5. Access to Knowledge**

Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.

We uphold these principles by fighting for transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.

[Find Allies](https://www.eff.org/electronic-frontier-alliance/allies)

## Are you part of an organization?

If your group supports principles uniting the Electronic Frontier Alliance, share them within your organization and [join the EFA](https://supporters.eff.org/join-the-efa) to connect with allies across the country.

## Coding with EFF

EFF has a team of staff technologists who spend a good portion of their time developing and maintaining software projects designed to defend civil liberties and enhance privacy and security online. We are looking for passionate individuals to volunteer their technological skills to support these software projects, and contribute to EFF's mission. To learn more and to get involved, please see our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page.

## EFF Cooperating Techs Announce List

EFF is often contacted by attorneys or members of the general public who have a need for technical assistance. The Cooperating Techs list is a low volume mailing list that connects these people with technologists who have the expertise and the desire to assist. We will post a note to the list with a basic description of the project or need; if you are qualified and interested, you respond to the call, and we'll connect you to the attorney. EFF won't investigate or vouch for either side so it is up to both parties to negotiate the work arrangements. We'll simply provide the connection.

[Subscribe](https://mail.eff.org/mailman/listinfo/effcooperatingtechs)

## EFF Cooperating Attorneys List

EFF receives many requests for legal assistance. In order to try to find help for as many people as possible, we maintain a post-only email list that attorneys can join called the Cooperating Attorneys list. The list receives anonymized requests for help, both directly on EFF cases and on cases where the EFF cannot offer assistance. If you are an attorney who is interested in joining the list, please contact the Legal Intake Coordinator at [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org) with the subject line, "Cooperating Attorney List Inquiry". More general information about the list can be found on our [Legal Assistance](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance#coopatty) page.

## Research with EFF

We are always looking for volunteers to do small research tasks to help build out the [Atlas of Surveillance](https://atlasofsurveillance.org/) dataset. Whether you’ve got 30 minutes or 30 hours to contribute, please sign up using to our list.

## Designing with EFF

EFF has a team of staff designers who create the [stunning artwork](https://www.flickr.com/photos/electronicfrontierfoundation "EFF Flickr page") we use on our sites and in our campaigns. Thanks to the talent we have on staff, we don't generally have much immediate need for volunteer design help, but there are still some ways that artists, designers, photographers and other visual thinkers can contribute.

Designers with expertise in UI and UX may wish to contribute to one of our many open source projects. See our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page, which has information on how to contribute to our [Open Source Design Repository](https://github.com/EFForg/design "EFF design on Github") on Github.

Artists, illustrators, photographers, and poster or meme designers may wish to share their work through the online Commons. We encourage the use of a [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ "CC Attribution License") for visual works; if you can post it to a public online forum, and then alert our design team to its existence, we would be happy to consider using it. We especially appreciate images that reflect all sorts of Internet users in the world; particular projects we are especially inspired by include [WOC in Tech Stock Photos](https://www.wocintechchat.com/blog/wocintechphotos "WOC in Tech") and [Safersisters Gifs](https://medium.com/codingrights/safersisters-online-security-tips-in-gifs-222589166ed8 "Safersisters"). While we cannot promise immediate use of everything you share, we welcome your creative contributions to the Commons, and we feel it is likely that others will value your work as well.

Photographers & Illustrators: we are always looking for good stock images on a [CC-Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) featuring diverse users engaging with technologies. Hands on keyboards, hackers busy coding, [protestors holding up phones](https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-rights-and-black-led-movement-against-police-violence "Digital Rights and the Black-led Movement Against Police Violence"); these are some examples of photographic images we have looked for and found in the online Commons. Positive images of technology's potential are particularly welcome; dystopian images are also great, but easier to find.

Other Ways to Give
==================

Show your support and start conversations about online rights with EFF stickers, apparel, and more.

EFF is one of several, carefully selected Human and Civil Rights Organizations across the country that federal, some state and local employees can donate through payroll deductions. We are proud that so many government employees decide to support digital civil liberties as part of the annual Combined Federal Campaign, and would be happy to provide you with more information about how you can contribute, or visit their site at [http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html](http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html).

**EFF’s CFC Code is 10437.**

Even if you’re not a government employee, you can participate by representing EFF at local campaign events and fairs. Please contact Maggie Kazmierczak, EFF’s Membership Coordinator, at maggie@eff.org for training and informational materials to distribute at an event near your hometown.

Many workplaces match their employees’ charitable gifts, meaning EFF will receive anywhere from 50% to 200% in additional contributions, as long as you report the donation to your employer. There are usually three steps to the process:

EFF will take it from there. If you want to help your colleagues, please add a description of the matching gifts procedure at your company and links to any forms available online at [https://eff.org/match](https://www.eff.org/match).

### **Legacy Giving**

Create a Legacy through the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Long-Term Investment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties

There are many ways you can make a significant gift to EFF that will provide you with tax savings and other benefits. Depending upon your unique financial planning objectives, you can be a major supporter of EFF using any or all of the giving methods described below. It is important, regardless of the size of your estate, to have a properly executed plan to ensure that you, not the courts, determine who will receive your property upon your death. When you create a will or living trust with a qualified advisor, attorney, accountant and/or financial planner, you ensure that your intentions are carried out. You are also ensuring that the needs of the people and organizations you care about will be met. The Development Office is prepared to work closely with you and your financial advisors to explain the benefits of each gift category. We encourage you to consult with your tax advisor for specific information about your own estate and financial planning goals.

### Bequests

The amount of a bequest gift is fully deductible for estate tax purposes. Gifts of securities, real property, and business interests may be made as bequests. Some sample language you can use to include EFF in your estate plan: "I bequeath to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, California 94109, the sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ($) dollars for its general purposes."

### Gifts of Life Insurance

By naming EFF the owner and beneficiary of an existing policy, you receive a tax deduction for the cash surrender value. You may also decide to make EFF the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. If you make gifts to EFF in the amount of the policy's premiums, you can take a charitable income tax deduction (provided EFF is not obligated to use the payments to cover the policy's premium).

### Retirement Plans

You can name EFF as a beneficiary of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 401 (k) Plan, 403 (b) Plan, Qualified Pension Plan, or Qualified Profit-Sharing Plan. Transferring these assets to a family member at the death of the plan participant may trigger two potential federal taxes: estate tax and income tax. When a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, the combination of these taxes could consume most of the assets intended for transfer. Since EFF is a tax-exempt organization, we do not have to pay taxes on the income from the plan. Your plan administrator can provide you with a beneficiary form.

### Financial Accounts

By including EFF as a beneficiary of a bank account, brokerage account, mutual fund account, or an asset such as a certificate of deposit (CD), you can provide a legacy gift to support our work. Your estate would receive a charitable deduction equal to the amount of the gift. Simply fill out a beneficiary designation form obtained from the institution holding your account.

### Specific language for a bequest

> Organization name: Electronic Frontier Foundation
>
> Address: 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109
>
> Tax identification number: 04-3091431
>

>
> Legal Language: Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, organized and existing under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and with the principal business address of 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109.

### **Hardware Donations**

EFF is always grateful to receive donations of computing equipment and related hardware, which can be of great benefit to our organization's work. However, our needs are specific, and we cannot accept unsolicited equipment.

EFF is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization (FEIN 04-3091431) as recognized by the Internal Revenue Service. No goods or services, in whole or in part, were received in exchange for this contribution, therefore, the full fair-market value of your contribution is deductible for income tax purposes in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations.

### **Organizational Membership**

Donations from businesses and other organizations allow EFF to address challenges to digital freedom wherever we are needed most.

### **Online Purchases: [eBay](http://givingworks.ebay.com/), [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/)**

### **Stock Donations**

A gift of appreciated stock generally offers a twofold tax savings. First, you avoid paying any capital gains tax on the increase in the value of the stock. Second, you receive a charitable income tax deduction for the fair market value of the stock on the date it is transferred. Make sure you have owned the stock for a "long-term" period (more than 12 months) to qualify for these tax advantages. Gifts of appreciated stock are fully deductible--up to a maximum of 30% of your adjusted gross income. Please check with your accountant or tax advisor regarding your particular tax status.

To facilitate the transfer of securities, please use the following information:

- Brokerage Firm: Morgan Stanley
- Account Name: Electronic Frontier Foundation

## **OTHER WAYS TO GIVE**

**What kinds of donations do you take?**

[You can give through EFF’s online form](https://www.eff.org/donate)— _and even become an official EFF member!_—by using any major credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or cryptocurrency via BitPay. As of this writing, you can use BitPay to donate Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and 5 USD-pegged stablecoins (GUSD, USDC, USDP, DAI, and BUSD).

You can donate by check or money order payable to EFF by using [our mail-in form](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-mail-membership-form). Send it to EFF at 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109 USA.

EFF accepts other types of donations including [stock](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#stock), [car donations](http://eff.careasy.org/home.html), [several cryptocurrencies](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#crypto), [employer matching gifts](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#employee), and [more](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support). If you're interested in donating to EFF another way, or can't find the information you're looking for on this page, please reach out to us at membership@eff.org.

**What information do you need to accept a stock gift?**

Thank you for your interest in donating stock! Please let us know in advance if you are transmitting securities via DTC by contacting EFF's Associate Director of Donor Relations, Nicole Puller via email at nicole@eff.org. Alternatively, you can contact Development Director Aaron Jue at aaron@eff.org. We’ll need to know the amount and type of shares that you will be donating. This is because our broker’s stock confirmation reports include the amount and type of received shares but not details regarding who the donor is. As a result, we’ll know that shares are received but not who they were from. When you reach out to confirm the stock transfer details, it allows us to make sure that you receive a receipt in a timely way. [Find more information here.](https://www.eff.org/pages/other-ways-give-and-donor-support#stock)

**I made a stock gift but never got a receipt. Where is it?**

There are a few possible reasons why you might not have gotten a receipt. We send receipts in the mail, so if we have an outdated mailing address for you in our records, the receipt won’t reach you. Also, we request that donors let us know in advance when they’re making a stock donation. This is because our broker’s stock confirmation reports include the amount and type of received shares but not details regarding the donor. As a result, we’ll know that shares are received but not who they were from. If this applies to you, we would have been unable to issue a receipt until you contact us to confirm what shares were from you. In either case, please reach out to EFF's Associate Director of Donor Relations, Nicole Puller via email at nicole@eff.org, so that she can remedy this for you.

**How can I volunteer?**

## **DONOR POLICY**

**A note to our donors**

Because we seek to represent the public good, and the rights of technology users from all backgrounds, we always act independently from the sources of our funding. That means that donors do not set or influence our agenda or our positions.

## **OR****GANIZATIONAL MEMBERSHIPS**

**What is an organizational membership?**

Organizational membership is open to any company, private foundation, or organization that donates at least $5,000 per year (or $2,000 per year for organizations with less than $5M revenue per year) and agrees to EFF's org member pledge (below). Membership includes a range of benefits that vary by level. While EFF does not endorse private companies or their products, we're grateful for their contributions. Since we're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the donation is tax deductible.

_Organizational Member Pledge:_ By supporting EFF, we share in EFF’s commitment to help create a world in which technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all the people of the world, without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or age. We also understand that EFF does not endorse private companies or their products or services, regardless of organizational membership status. We will not use the EFF org member badge in any manner that identifies EFF as a “partner,” “sponsor,” or otherwise implies that EFF has endorsed our organization.

**How do I become an organizational member?**

Learn more about the organizational membership program's levels, benefits, and how to donate [here](https://www.eff.org/thanks#organizational_members) [.](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/organizational-donation)

**How are organizational members recognized?**

Organizational member recognition varies by member level, but members that choose to be recognized publicly are included on our org member page, as well as other opportunities including shout outs in our EFFector e-mails, social media platforms, at EFF events, and our annual report. See the [organizational member page](https://www.eff.org/thanks#organizational_members) for logos of current members, as well as member benefits, including recognition. Organizational member links include the rel="nofollow" attribute: We adopted this policy to screen out potential abuse of our program and site to raise the rank of third parties in search algorithms. Unfortunately, this is a growing problem for nonprofits. This was a complex decision since we know many of the sincere supporters behind these companies, but we decided that it was the best choice for us.

**Can my company sponsor an EFF event?**

Thank you for your interest in sponsoring an EFF event! We have several annual events with varying sponsorship opportunities, including [Tech Trivia](https://www.eff.org/event/effs-6th-annual-tech-trivia-night "2022 Tech Trivia announcement"), [Cyberlaw Trivia](https://www.eff.org/event/effs-14th-annual-cyberlaw-trivia-night "2022 Cyberlaw Trivia announcement"), and the [EFF Awards](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/eff-awards-2022-celebration "2022 EFF Awards recap").

Other Ways to Give
==================

Show your support and start conversations about online rights with EFF stickers, apparel, and more.

EFF is one of several, carefully selected Human and Civil Rights Organizations across the country that federal, some state and local employees can donate through payroll deductions. We are proud that so many government employees decide to support digital civil liberties as part of the annual Combined Federal Campaign, and would be happy to provide you with more information about how you can contribute, or visit their site at [http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html](http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html).

**EFF’s CFC Code is 10437.**

Even if you’re not a government employee, you can participate by representing EFF at local campaign events and fairs. Please contact Maggie Kazmierczak, EFF’s Membership Coordinator, at maggie@eff.org for training and informational materials to distribute at an event near your hometown.

Many workplaces match their employees’ charitable gifts, meaning EFF will receive anywhere from 50% to 200% in additional contributions, as long as you report the donation to your employer. There are usually three steps to the process:

EFF will take it from there. If you want to help your colleagues, please add a description of the matching gifts procedure at your company and links to any forms available online at [https://eff.org/match](https://www.eff.org/match).

### **Legacy Giving**

Create a Legacy through the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Long-Term Investment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties

There are many ways you can make a significant gift to EFF that will provide you with tax savings and other benefits. Depending upon your unique financial planning objectives, you can be a major supporter of EFF using any or all of the giving methods described below. It is important, regardless of the size of your estate, to have a properly executed plan to ensure that you, not the courts, determine who will receive your property upon your death. When you create a will or living trust with a qualified advisor, attorney, accountant and/or financial planner, you ensure that your intentions are carried out. You are also ensuring that the needs of the people and organizations you care about will be met. The Development Office is prepared to work closely with you and your financial advisors to explain the benefits of each gift category. We encourage you to consult with your tax advisor for specific information about your own estate and financial planning goals.

### Bequests

The amount of a bequest gift is fully deductible for estate tax purposes. Gifts of securities, real property, and business interests may be made as bequests. Some sample language you can use to include EFF in your estate plan: "I bequeath to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, California 94109, the sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ($) dollars for its general purposes."

### Gifts of Life Insurance

By naming EFF the owner and beneficiary of an existing policy, you receive a tax deduction for the cash surrender value. You may also decide to make EFF the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. If you make gifts to EFF in the amount of the policy's premiums, you can take a charitable income tax deduction (provided EFF is not obligated to use the payments to cover the policy's premium).

### Retirement Plans

You can name EFF as a beneficiary of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 401 (k) Plan, 403 (b) Plan, Qualified Pension Plan, or Qualified Profit-Sharing Plan. Transferring these assets to a family member at the death of the plan participant may trigger two potential federal taxes: estate tax and income tax. When a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, the combination of these taxes could consume most of the assets intended for transfer. Since EFF is a tax-exempt organization, we do not have to pay taxes on the income from the plan. Your plan administrator can provide you with a beneficiary form.

### Financial Accounts

By including EFF as a beneficiary of a bank account, brokerage account, mutual fund account, or an asset such as a certificate of deposit (CD), you can provide a legacy gift to support our work. Your estate would receive a charitable deduction equal to the amount of the gift. Simply fill out a beneficiary designation form obtained from the institution holding your account.

John Perry Barlow Library
=========================

John Perry Barlow (1947-2018), a poet and Internet philosopher, was a cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a member of our Board of Directors from 1990 until his death. Barlow's passion for life, liberty, and human connection brought him in contact with a staggering range of people and made him an inspiration all around the world—and to us. In his work as an Internet activist, he made us all think about what computer networks might be and to approach the digital future with hope.

[Barlow Symposium](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/building-great-collective-organism-mind-john-perry-barlow-symposium-0 "Barlow Symposium")

Internet Luminaries Explore Barlow's Philosophy

It is no exaggeration to say that major parts of the Internet we all know and love today exist and thrive because of Barlow’s vision and leadership. He always saw the Internet as a fundamental place of freedom, where voices long silenced can find an audience and people can connect with others regardless of physical distance. He was among the first to [note](https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/idea_economy.article.txt) that: "the difficulty of enforcing existing copyright and patent laws is already placing in peril the ultimate source of intellectual property - the free exchange of ideas." and that "\[T\]he greatest constraint on your future liberties may come not from government but from corporate legal departments laboring to protect by force what can no longer be protected by practical efficiency or general social consent."

Barlow was sometimes held up as a straw man for a kind of naive techno-utopianism that believed that the Internet could solve all of humanity's problems without causing any more. Nothing could be further from the truth. Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter: "I knew it’s also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls 'turn-key totalitarianism.'”

Barlow’s lasting legacy is that he [devoted his life to making the Internet into](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) “a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth . . . a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”

Here, we collect a portion of his writings and documents about him. There is much ageless wisdom here, as well as commentary that is based firmly in the first legal and moral issues facing the nascent Internet.  Enjoy.

A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace
===============================================

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.

You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.

You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.

We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.

Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.

In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.

You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.

In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.

These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.

We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

Decrypting the Puzzle Palace
============================

### by John Perry Barlow

Previously published in the July, 1992 issue of _[Communications of the ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/129902.129910)._

_A little sunlight is the best disinfectant._ --Justice Louis Brandeis

Over a year ago, in a condition of giddier innocence than I enjoy today, I wrote the following about the discovery of Cyberspace: Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no other side. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate which expands with development.

One less felicitous feature of this terrain which I hadn't noticed at the time was a long-encamped and immense army of occupation.

This army represents interests which are difficult to define. It guards the area against unidentified enemies. It meticulously observes almost every activity undertaken there, and continuously prevents most who inhabit its domain from drawing any blinds against such observation.

This army marshals at least 40,000 troops, owns the most advanced computing resources in the world, and uses funds the dispersal of which does not fall under any democratic review.

Imagining this force won't require the inventive powers of a William Gibson. The American Occupation Army of Cyberspace exists. Its name is the National Security Agency.

It can be argued that this peculiar institution inhibits free trade, has damaged American competitiveness, and poses a threat to liberty anywhere people communicate with electrons. Its principal function, as my colleague John Gilmore puts it, is "wire-tapping the world." It is free to do this without a warrant from any judge.

It is legally constrained from domestic surveillance, but precious few people are in a good position to watch what, how, or whom the NSA watches. Those who are tend to be temperamentally sympathetic to its objectives and methods. They like power, and power understands the importance of keeping it own secrets and learning everyone else's.

Whether it is meticulously ignoring every American byte or not, the NSA is certainly pursuing policies which will render our domestic affairs transparent to anyone who can afford big digital hardware. Such policies could have profound consequences on our liberty and privacy.

More to point, the role of the NSA in the area of domestic privacy needs to be assessed in the light of other recent federal initiatives which seem aimed at permanently denying privacy to the inhabitants of Cyberspace, whether foreign or American.

Finally it seems an opportune time, directly following our disorienting victory in the Cold War, to ask if the threats from which the NSA purportedly protects Americans from are as significant as the hazards the NSA's activities present.

Like most Americans I'd never given much thought to the NSA until recently. (Indeed its very existence was a secret for much of my life. Beltway types used to joke that NSA stood for "No Such Agency.") I vaguely knew that the NSA was one of the twelve or so shadowy federal spook houses erected shortly after the creation of the Iron Curtain with the purpose of stopping its advance.

The NSA originated in response to a memorandum sent by Harry Truman on October 24, 1952 to Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Defense Secretary Robert Lovatt. This memo, the very existence of which remained secret for almost 40 years, created the NSA, placed it under the authority of the Secretary of Defense, and charged it with monitoring and decoding any signal transmission relevant to the security of the United States.

Even after I started noticing the NSA, my natural immunity to paranoia combined with a belief in the incompetence of all bureaucracies continued to mute any sense of alarm. This was before I began to understand the subterranean battles raging over data encryption and the NSA's role in them. Lately, I'm less sanguine.

Encryption may be the only reliable method for securing privacy in the inherently public domain of Cyberspace. I certainly trust it more than privacy protection laws. Relying on government to protect your privacy is like asking a peeping tom to install your window blinds.

In fact, we already have a strong-sounding federal law protecting our electronic privacy, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or ECPA. But this law is not very effective in those areas where electronic eaves dropping is technically easy. This is especially true in the area of cellular phone conversations, which, under the current analog transmission standard, are easily accessible to anyone from the FBI to you.

The degree of present-day law enforcement apprehension over secure cellular encryption provides evidence of how seriously they've been taking ECPA. Law enforcement organizations are moving on a variety of fronts to see that robust electronic privacy protection systems don't become generally available to the public. Indeed, the current administration may be so determined to achieve this end they may be willing to paralyze progress in America's most promising technologies rather than yield.

Push is coming to shove in two areas of communications technology: digital transmission of heretofore analog signals, and the encryption of transmitted data.

As the communications service providers move to packet switching, fiber optic transmission lines, digital wireless, ISDN and other advanced techniques, what have been discrete channels of continuous electrical impulses, voices audible to anyone with alligator clips on the right wires, are now becoming chaotic blasts of data packets, readily intelligible only to the sender and receiver. This development effectively forecloses traditional wire-tapping techniques, even as it provides new and different opportunities for electronic surveillance.

It is in the latter area where the NSA knows its stuff. A fair percentage of the digital signals dispatched on planet Earth must pass at some point through the NSA's big sieve in Fort Meade, Maryland, 12 underground acres of the heaviest hardware in the computing world. There, unless these packets are also encrypted with a particularly knotty algorithm, sorting them back into their original continuity is not very difficult.

In 1991, alarmed at a future in which it would have to sort through an endless fruit salad of encrypted bits, the FBI persuaded Senator Joseph Biden to include certain language in Senate Bill 266. The new language in the bill required electronic communications services and those who created communications devices to implement only such encryption methods as would assure government's ability to extract the plain text of any voice or data communications in which it took a legal interest. It was as if the government had responded to a technological leap in lock design by requiring all building contractors to supply it with skeleton keys to every door in America.

The provision raised wide-spread concern in the computer community, which was better equipped to understand its implications than the general public. In August of last year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in cooperation with Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and other industry groups, successfully lobbied to have it removed from the bill.

Our celebration was restrained. We knew we hadn't seen the last of it. For one thing, the movement to digital communications does create some serious obstacles to traditional wire-tapping procedures. I fully expected that law enforcement would be back with new proposals, which I hoped might be ones we could support. But what I didn't understand then, and am only now beginning to appreciate, was the extent to which this issue had already been engaged by the NSA in the obscure area of export controls over data encryption algorithms. Encryption algorithms, despite their purely defensive characteristics, have been regarded by the government of this country as weapons of war for many years. If they are to be employed for privacy (as opposed to authentication) and they are any good at all, their export is licensed under State Department's

International Traffic in Arms Regulations or ITAR.

The encryption watchdog is the NSA. It has been enforcing a policy, neither debated nor even admitted to, which holds that if a device or program contains an encryption scheme which the NSA canUt break fairly easily, it will not be licensed for international sale. Aside for marveling at the silliness of trying to embargo algorithms, a practice about as pragmatic as restricting the export of wind, I didn't pay much attention to the implications of NSA encryption policies until February of this year. It was then that I learned about the deliberations of an obscure group of cellular industry representatives called the Ad Hoc Authentication Task Force, TR45.3 and of the influence which the NSA has apparently exercised over their findings.

In the stately fashion characteristic of standard-setting bodies, this group has been working for several years on a standard for digital cellular transmission, authentication, and privacy protection. This standard is known by the characteristically whimsical telco moniker IS-54B.

In February they met near Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. At that meeting, they recommended, and agreed not to publish, an encryption scheme for American-made digital cellular systems which many sophisticated observers believe to be intentionally vulnerable. It was further thought by many observers that this Rdumbing downS had been done indirect cooperation with the NSA. Given the secret nature of the new algorithm, its actual merits were difficult to assess. But many cryptologists believe there is enough in the published portions of the standard to confirm that it isnUt any good.

One cryptographic expert, who asked not to be identified lest the NSA take reprisals against his company, said: "The voice privacy scheme, as opposed to the authentication scheme, is pitifully easy to break. It involves the generation of two \`voice privacy masks' each 260 bits long. They are generated as a byproduct of the authentication algorithm and remain fixed for the duration of a call. The voice privacy masks are exclusive\_ORed with each frame of data

from the vocoder at the transmitter. The receiver XORs the same mask with the incoming data frame to recover the original plain text. Anyone familiar with the fundamentals of cryptanalysis can easily see how weak this scheme is."

And indeed, Whitfield Diffie, co-inventor of Public Key cryptography and arguably the dean of this obscure field, told me this about the fixed masks: "Given that description of the encryption process, there is no need for the opponents to know how the masks were generated. Routine cryptanalytic operations will quickly determine the masks and remove them."

Some on the committee claimed that possible NSA refusal of export licensing had no bearing on the algorithm they chose. But their decision not to publish the entire method and expose it to cryptanalytical abuse (not to mention ANSI certification) was accompanied by the following convoluted justification: "It is the belief of the majority of the Ad Hoc Group, based on our current understanding of the export requirements, that a published algorithm would facilitate the cracking of the algorithm to the extent that its fundamental purpose is defeated or compromised." (Emphasis added.)

Now this is a weird paragraph any way you parse it, but its most singular quality is the sudden, incongruous appearance of export requirements in a paragraph otherwise devoted to algorithmic integrity. In fact, this paragraph is itself code, the plain text of which goes something like this: "We're adopting this algorithm because, if we don't, the NSA will slam an export embargo on all domestically manufactured digital cellular phones."

Obviously, the cellular phone system manufacturers and providers are not going to produce one model for overseas sale and another for domestic production. Thus, a primary effect of NSA-driven efforts to deny some unnamed foreign enemy secure cellular communications is on domestic security. The wireless channels available to Americans will be cloaked in a mathematical veil so thin that, as one crypto- expert put it, "Any county sheriff with the right PC-based black box will be able to monitor your cellular conversations."

When I heard him say that, it suddenly became clear to me that, whether consciously undertaken with that goal or not, the most important result of the NSA's encryption embargoes has been the future convenience of domestic law enforcement. Thanks to NSA export policies, they will be assured that, as more Americans protect their privacy with encryption, it will be of a sort easily penetrated by authority.

I find it increasingly hard to imagine this is not their real objective as well. Surely, the NSA must be aware of how ineffectual their efforts have been in keeping good encryption out of inimical military possession. An algorithm is somewhat less easily stopped at the border than, say, a nuclear reactor. As William Neukom, head of Microsoft Legal puts it, "The notion that you can control this technology is comical."

I became further persuaded that this was the case upon hearing, from a couple of sources, that the Russians have been using the possibly uncrackable (and American) RSA algorithm in their missile launch codes for the last ten years and that, for as little as five bucks, one can get a software package called Crypto II on the streets of Saint Petersburg which includes both RSA and DES encryption systems.

Nevertheless, the NSA has been willing to cost American business a lot of revenue rather than allow domestic products with strong encryption into the global market.

While it's impossible to set a credible figure on what that loss might add up to, it's high. Jim Bidzos, whose RSA Data Security licenses RSA, points to one major Swiss bid in which a hundred million dollar contract for financial computer terminals went to a European vendor after American companies were prohibited by the NSA from exporting a truly secure network.

The list of export software containing intentionally broken encryption is also long. Lotus Notes ships in two versions. Don't count on much protection from the encryption in the export version. Both Microsoft and Novell have been thwarted in their efforts to include RSA in their international networking software, despite frequent publication of the entire RSA algorithm in technical journals all over the world.

With hardware, the job has been easier. NSA levied against the inclusion of a DES chip in the AS/390 series IBM mainframes in late 1990 despite the fact that, by this time, DES was in widespread use around the world, including semi-official adoption by our official enemy, the USSR.

I now realize that the Soviets have not been the NSA's main concern at any time lately. Naively hoping that, with the collapse of the Evil Empire, the NSA might be out of work, I learned that, given their own vigorous crypto systems and their long use of some embargoed products, the Russians could not have been the threat from whom this forbidden knowledge was to be kept. Who has the enemy been then? I started to ask around.

Cited again and again as the real object of the embargoes were Third- World countries, terrorists and... criminals. Criminals, most generally drug-flavored, kept coming up, and nobody seemed concerned that some of their operations might be located in areas supposedly off- limits to NSA scrutiny.

Presumably the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.

But whether or not FISA has actually limited the NSA's abilities to conduct domestic surveillance seemed less relevant the more I thought about it. A better question to ask was, "Who is best served by the NSA's encryption export policies?" The answer is clear: domestic law enforcement. Was this the result of some plot between NSA and, say, the Department of Justice? Not necessarily.

Certainly in the case of the digital cellular standard, cultural congruity between foreign intelligence, domestic law enforcement, and what somebody referred to as "spook wannabes on the TR45.3 committee" might have a lot more to do with the its eventual flavor than any actual whisperings along the Potomac.

Unable to get anyone presently employed by the NSA to comment on this or any other matter, I approached a couple of old hands for a highly distilled sample of intelligence culture.

I called Admirals Stansfield Turner and Bobby Ray Inman. Their Carter administration positions as, respectively, CIA and NSA Directors, had endowed them with considerable experience in such matters In addition, both are generally regarded to be somewhat more sensitive to the limits of democratic power than their successors. And their successors seemed unlikely to return my calls. My phone conversations with Turner and Inman were amiable enough, but they didn't ease my gathering sense that the NSA takes an active interest in areas beyond its authorized field of scrutiny. Turner started out by saying he was in no position to confirm or deny any suspicions about direct NSA-FBI cooperation on encryption. Still, he didn't think I was being irrational in raising the question. In fact, he genially encouraged me to investigate the matter further. He also said that while a sub rosa arrangement between the NSA and the Department of Justice to compromise domestic encryption would be "injudicious," he could think of no law, including FISA (which he helped design), which would prevent it.

Alarmingly, this gentleman who has written eloquently on the hazards of surveillance in a democracy did not seem terribly concerned that our digital shelters are being rendered permanently translucent by and to the government. He said, "A threat could develop...terrorism, narcotics, whatever...where the public would be pleased that all electronic traffic was open to decryption. You can't legislate something which forecloses the possibility of meeting that kind of emergency."

Admiral Inman had even more enthusiasm for assertive governmental supervision. Although he admitted no real knowledge of the events behind the new cellular encryption standard, he wasn't disturbed to hear it might be purposely flawed.

And, despite the fact that his responsibilities as NSA Director had been restricted to foreign intelligence, he seemed a lot more comfortable talking about threats on the home front. "The Department of Justice," Inman began, "has a very legitimate worry. The major weapon against white collar crime has been the court-ordered wiretap. If the criminal elements go to using a high quality cipher, the principal defense against narcotics traffic is gone." This didn't sound like a guy who, were he still head of NSA, would rebuff FBI attempts to get a little help from his agency.

He brushed off my concerns about the weakness of the cellular encryption standard. "If all you're seeking is personal privacy, you can get that with a very minimal amount of encipherment." Well, I wondered, Privacy from whom?

Inman seemed to regard real, virile encryption to be something rather like a Saturday Night Special. "My answer," he said, "would be legislation which would make it a criminal offense to use encrypted communication to conceal criminal activity."

Wouldn't that render all encrypted traffic automatically suspect? I asked.

"Well," he said, "you could have a registry of institutions which can legally use ciphers. If you get somebody using one who isn't registered, then you go after him."

You can have my encryption algorithm, I thought to myself, when you pry my cold dead fingers from its private key.

It wasn't a big sample, but it was enough to gain an appreciation of the cultural climate of the intelligence community. And these guys are the liberals. What legal efficiencies might their Republican successors be willing to employ to protect the American Way? Without the familiar presence of the Soviets, we can expect a sharp increase in over-rated bogeymen and virtual states of emergency. This is already well under way. I think we can expect our drifting and confused hardliners to burn the Reichstag repeatedly until they have managed to extract from our induced alarm the sort of government which makes them feel safe.

This process has been under way for some time. One sees it in the war on terrorism, against which pursuit "no liberty is absolute," as Admiral Turner put it. This, despite the fact that, during last year for which I have a solid figure, 1987, only 7 Americans succumbed to terrorism.

You can also see it clearly under way in the War on Some Drugs. The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution has largely disappeared in this civil war. And among the people I spoke with, it seemed a common canon that drugs (by which one does not mean Jim Beam, Marlboros, Folger's, or Halcion) were a sufficient evil to merit the government's holding any keys it wanted.

One individual close to the committee said that at least some of the aforementioned "spook wannabes" on the committee were interested in weak cellular encryption because they considered warrants not "practical" when it came to pursuing drug dealers and other criminals using cellular phones.

In a fearful America, where the people cry for shorter chains and smaller cages, such privileges as secure personal communications are increasingly regarded as expendable luxuries. As Whitfield Diffie put it, "From the consistent way in which Americans seem to put security ahead of freedom, I fear that most would prefer that all electronic traffic was open to government decryption."

In any event, while I found no proof of an NSA-FBI conspiracy to gut the American cellular phone encryption standard, it seemed clear to me that none was needed. The same results can be delivered by a cultural "auto-conspiracy" between like-minded hardliners and cellular companies who will care about privacy only when their customers do.

You don't have to be a hand-wringing libertarian like me to worry about the domestic consequences of the NSA's encryption embargoes. They are also, as stated previously, bad for business. Unless, of course, the business of America is no longer business but, as sometimes seems the case these days, crime control.

As Ron Rivest (the "R" in RSA) said to me, "We have the largest information-based economy in the world. We have lots of reasons for wanting to protect information, and weakening our encryption systems for the convenience of law enforcement doesn't serve the national interest."

But by early March, it was clear that this "business-oriented" administration had made a clear choice to favor cops over commerce even if the costs to the American economy were to become extremely high.

A sense of White House seriousness in this regard could be taken from their response to the first serious effort by Congress to bring the NSA to task for its encryption embargoes. Rep. Mel Levine (D- Calif.) proposed an amendment to the Export Administration Act to transfer mass market software controls to the Commerce Department, which would relax the rules. The administration responded by saying that they would veto the entire bill if the Levine amendment remained attached to it.

Even though it appeared the NSA had little to fear from Congress, the Levine amendment may have been part of what placed the agency in a bargaining mood for the first time. They entered into discussions with the Software Publishers Association who, acting primarily on behalf of Microsoft and Lotus, got to them to agree "in principle" to a streamlined process for export licensing of encryption which might provide for more robust standards than previously allowed.

But the negotiations between the NSA and the SPA were being conducted behind closed doors. The NSA imposed an understanding that any agreement would be set forth only in a "confidential" letter to Congress. As in the case of the digital cellular standard, this would eliminate the public scrutiny by cryptography researchers.

Furthermore, some cryptographers worried that the encryption key lengths to which the SPA appeared willing to restrict its members might be too short for the sorts of brute-force decryption assaults which advances in processor technology will yield in the near future. And brute force decryption has always been the NSA's strong suit. The impression engendered by the style of the NSA-SPA negotiations did not inspire confidence. The lack of confidence will operate to the continued advantage of foreign manufacturers in an era when more and more institutions are going to be concerned about the privacy of their digital communications.

But the economic damage which the NSA-SPA agreement might cause would be minor compared to what would result from a startling new federal initiative, the Department of Justice's proposed legislation on digital telephony. If you're wondering what happened to the snooping provisions which were in Senate Bill 266, look no further. They're back. Bigger and bolder than before.

They are contained in a sweeping proposal by the Justice Department to the Senate Commerce Committee. It proposes legislation which would "require providers of electronic communications services and private branch exchanges to ensure that the Government's ability to lawfully intercept communications is unimpeded by the introduction of advanced digital telecommunications technology or any other telecommunications technology."

This really means what it says: before any advance in telecommunications technology can be deployed, the service providers and manufacturers must assure the cops that they can tap into it. In other words, development in digital communications technology must come to a screeching halt until The Department of Justice can be assured that it will be able to grab and examine data packets with the same facility they have long enjoyed with analog wire-tapping.

It gets worse. The initiative also provides that, if requested by the Attorney General, "any Commission proceeding concerning regulations, standards or registrations issued or to be issued under authority of this section shall be closed to the public." This essentially places the Attorney General in a position to shut down any telecommunications advance without benefit of public hearing.

When I first heard of the digital telephony proposal, I assumed it was a kind of bargaining chip. I couldn't imagine it was serious. But it now appears they are going to the mattresses on this one.

Taken together with NSA's continued assertion of its authority over encryption, a pattern becomes clear. The government of the United States is so determined to maintain law enforcement's traditional wire-tapping abilities in the digital age that it is willing to cripple the American economy. This may sound hyperbolic, but I believe it is not.

The greatest technological advantages this country presently enjoys are in the areas of software and telecommunications. Furthermore, thanks in large part to the Internet, much of America is already wired for bytes. This is as significant an economic edge in the Information Age as the existence of a railroad system was for England one hundred fifty years ago.

If we continue to permit the NSA to cripple our software and further convey to the Department of Justice the right to stop development the Net without public input, we are sacrificing both our economic future and our liberties. And all in the name of combating terrorism and drugs.

This has now gone far enough. I have always been inclined to view the American government as fairly benign as such creatures go. I am generally the least paranoid person I know, but there is something scary about a government which cares more about putting its nose in your business than it does about keeping that business healthy. As I write this, a new ad hoc working group on digital privacy, coordinated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is scrambling to meet the challenge. The group includes representatives from organizations like AT&T, the Regional Bells, IBM, Microsoft, the Electronic Mail Association and about thirty other companies and public interest groups.

Under the direction of Jerry Berman, EFF's Washington office director, and John Podesta, a capable lobbyist and privacy specialist who helped draft the ECPA, this group intends to stop the provisions in digital telephony proposal from entering the statute books.

We intend to work with federal law enforcement officials to address their legitimate concerns. We donUt dispute their need to conduct some electronic surveillance, but we believe this can be assured by more restrained methods than they're proposing. We are also preparing a thorough examination of the NSA's encryption export policies and looking into the constitutional implications of those policies. Rather than negotiating behind closed doors, as the SPA has been attempting to do, America's digital industries have a strong self-interest in banding together to bring the NSA's procedures and objectives into the sunlight of public discussion.

Finally, we are hoping to open a dialog with the NSA. We need to develop a better understanding of their perception of the world and its threats. Who are they guarding us against and how does encryption fit into that endeavor? Despite our opposition to their policies on encryption export, we assume that NSA operations have some merit. But we would like to be able to rationally balance the merits against the costs.

The legal right to express oneself is meaningless if there is no secure medium through which that expression may travel. By the same token, the right to hold unpopular opinions is forfeit unless one can discuss those opinions with others of like mind without the government listening in.

Even if you trust the current American government, as I am still inclined to, there is a kind of corrupting power in the ability to create public policy in secret while assuring that the public will have little secrecy of its own.

In its secrecy and technological might, the NSA already occupies a very powerful position. And conveying to the Department of Justice what amounts to licensing authority for all communications technology would give it a control of information distribution rarely asserted over English-speaking people since Oliver Cromwell's Star Chamber Proceedings.

Are there threats, foreign or domestic, which are sufficiently grave to merit the conveyance of such vast legal and technological might? And even if the NSA and FBI may be trusted with such power today, will they always be trustworthy? Will we be able to do anything about it if they aren't?

Senator Frank Church said of NSA technology in 1975 words which are more urgent today: "That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left. There would be no place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny. There would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capacity of this technology."

A Not Terribly Brief History of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
==================================================================

by John Perry Barlow

Thursday, November 8, 1990

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was started by a visit from the FBI.

In late April of 1990, I got a call from Special Agent Richard Baxter of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He asked if he could come by the next
day and discuss a certain investigation with me. His unwillingness to
discuss its nature over the phone left me with a sense of global guilt, but
I figured turning him down would probably send the wrong signal.

On Mayday, he drove to Pinedale, Wyoming, a cow town 100 miles north of his
Rock Springs office (where he ordinarily investigates livestock theft and
other regional crimes). He brought with him a thick stack of documents
from the San Francisco office and a profound confusion about their
contents.

He had been sent to find out if I might be a member of the NuPromtheus
League, a dread band of info-terrorists (or maybe just a disaffected former
Apple employee) who had stolen and wantonly distributed source code
normally used in the Macintosh ROMs. Agent Baxter's errand was complicated
by a fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized
right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have
to explain to him what guilt might be.

The three hours I passed doing this were surreal for both of us. Whatever
this source code stuff was, and whatever it was that happened to it, had
none of the cozy familiarity of a few yearling steers headed across the
Wyoming border in the wrong stock truck.

What little he did know, thanks to the San Francisco office, was also
pretty well out of kilter. He had been told, for example, that Autodesk,
the publisher of AutoCAD, was a major Star Wars defense contractor and that
its CEO was none other than John Draper, the infamous phone phreak also
known as Cap'n Crunch. As soon as I quit laughing, I started to worry.

I realized in the course of this interview that I was seeing, in microcosm,
the entire law enforcement structure of the United States. Agent Baxter was
hardly alone in his puzzlement about the legal, technical, and metaphorical
nature of datacrime.

I also found in his struggles a framework for understanding a series of
recent Secret Service raids on some young hackers I'd met in a Harper's
magazine forum on computers and freedom. And it occurred to me that this
might be the beginning of a great paroxysm of governmental confusion during
which everyone's liberties would become at risk.

When Agent Baxter had gone, I wrote an account of his visit and placed it
on the WELL, a computer BBS in Sausalito which is digital home to a large
collection of technically hip folks, including Mitch Kapor, the father of
Lotus 1-2-3.

Turns out Mitch had also been visited by the FBI, owing to his having
unaccountably received of one of the source code disks which NuPrometheus
scattered around. Mitch's experience had been as dreamlike as mine. He
had, in fact, filed the whole thing under General Inexplicability until he
read my tale on the WELL. Now he had enough corroboration for his own
strange sense of alarm to begin acting on it.

Several days later, he found his bizjet about to fly over Wyoming on its
way to San Francisco. He called me from somewhere over South Dakota and
asked if he might literally drop in for a chat about Agent Baxter and
related matters.

So, while a late spring snow storm swirled outside my office, we spent
several hours hatching what became the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I
told him about the sweep of Secret Service raids which had taken place
several months before and their apparent disregard for the Bill of Rights.

Alarmed, he gave me the phone number of Harvey Silverglate, whose
willingness to champion unpopular causes was demonstrated by his current
defense of Leona Helmsley. He said that Harvey would probably know if this
were as bad as it was starting to sound. He also said that he would be
willing to pay the bills that generally start to appear whenever you call a
lawyer.

I finally found Harvey in the New York offices of Rabinowitz, Boudin,
Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman, a firm whose long list of successfully
defended liberties includes the Pentagon Papers case. I told him and Eric
Lieberman what I knew about recent government flailings against cybercrime.
They were even less sanguine than I had been.

The next day a trio code-named Acid Phreak, Phiber Optik, and Scorpion
entered the walnut-panelled chambers of Rabinowitz, Boudin and told their
tales to a young lawyer there named Terry Gross. While EFF as a formal
organization would not exist for another two months, its legal arm was
already flexing its muscle.

A few days later I received a phone call from the technology writer for the
Washington Post. He was interested in following up on the Harper's forum,
and knew nothing of Mitch's and my joint endeavors. I filled him in,
hoping to expose the Secret Service. Several days later, the Post
published the first of many newspaper stories, all of which could have
shared the same headline: LOTUS FOUNDER DEFENDS HACKERS.

While this was an irritating misrepresentation...we were more interested in
defending the Constitution than any digital miscreants...the publicity
produced a couple of major supporters: Steve Wozniak, who called and
offered an unlimited match to Mitch's contributions, and John Gilmore (Sun
Microsystems employee #5) who e-mailed me a six figure offer of support.

Meanwhile, the list of apparent outrages lengthened. We learned about an
Austin role-playing games publisher named Steve Jackson whose office
equipment had been confiscated by the Secret Service in an apparent effort
to restrain his publication of a game called Cyberpunk which they thought,
with ludicrous inaccuracy, to be "a handbook for computer crime.

All over the country computer bulletins being confiscated, undelivered
e-mail and all. A Secret Service dragnet called Operation Sundevil seized
more than 40 computers and 23,000 data disks from teenagers in 14 American
cities, using levels of force and terror which would have been more
appropriate to the apprehension of urban guerrillas than barely
post-pubescent computer nerds.

And there was the Craig Neidorf case. Neidorf, also known by the nom de
crack Knight Lightning, had published an internal BellSouth document in his
electronic magazine Phrack. For this constitutionally protected act,
Neidorf was being charged with interstate transport of stolen property with
a possible sentence of 60 years in jail and a $122,000 in fines.

I wrote a piece about these events called Crime & Puzzlement. Although I
did so at the request of the Whole Earth Review...it made its first print
appearance in the Fall 1990 issue of WER...I "published" it on the Net in
June and was astonished by the response. It was like planting a fence-post
and discovering that the "ground" into which you've driven it is actually
the back of a giant animal which quivers and heaves at the irritation.

By July, I was receiving up to 100 e-mail messages a day. They came from
all over the planet and expressed nearly universal indignation. I began to
experience datashock, but I also realized that Mitch and I were not alone
in our concerns. We had struck a chord.

In Cambridge, Mitch was having something like the same experience. Since
the Washington Post story, he found himself bathed in media glare.
However, the more he learned about ambiguous nature of law in Cyberspace,
the more of his considerable intellectual and financial resources he became
willing to devote to the subject.

In late June, Mitch and I threw several dinners in San Francisco, to which
we invited major figures from the computer industry. We weren't surprised
to learn than many of them had exploits in their past which, undertaken
today, would arouse plenty of Secret Service interest. It appeared
possible that one side-effect of current government practices might be the
elimination of the next generation of computer entrepreneurs and digital
designers.

It also became clear that we were dealing with a set of problems which was
a great deal more complex and far-reaching than a few cases of governmental
confusion. The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a
growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information
Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and
conveyance of information itself.

We realized that our legal actions on behalf of a few teen-age crackers
would go on indefinitely without much result unless something were done to
ease social tensions along the electronic frontier. The real task at hand
was the civilization of Cyberspace. Such an undertaking would require more
juice and stamina than two men could muster, even amplified by the Net and
a solid financial supply. We would need some kind of organizational
identity.

With this in mind, we hired a press coordinator, Cathy Cook (who had
formerly done PR for Steve Jobs), set a squad of lawyers to work on
investigating the proper organizational tax status, and, over a San
Francisco dinner with Stewart Brand, Nat Goldhaber, Jaron Lanier, and Chuck
Blanchard, we selected a name and defined a mission.

We announced the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation at the
National Press Club on July 10. Mitch and I were joined for the
announcement by Harvey Silverglate, Terry Gross, and Steve Jackson.

We were also joined by Marc Rotenberg of the Washington office of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility. One of our first official acts
had been to grant that organization $275,000 for a project on computing and
civil liberties. CPSR would keep a wary eye on developments "inside the
Beltway" and work in conjunction with congressional staffers to see that
any legislation dealing with access to information was sensibly drafted.

While in Washington, we also took inventory of the terrain, meeting with
congressional staffers, the Washington civil liberties establishment, and
officials from the Library of Congress and the White House. The area to be
covered, from intellectual property to telecommunications policy to law
enforcement technique, was daunting, as were the ambient levels of
confusion and indifference.

We also generated an enormous amount of press. And it became apparent that
not everyone was persuaded of our cause. Business Week called Mitch naive
for his willingness to believe that computer crackers were somehow less
dangerous that drug kingpins. Various burghers of the computer
establishment, ranging from the executive director of the Software
Publishers Association to a columnist for ComputerWorld, called us fools at
best and, more likely, dangerous fools.

The Wall Street Journal printed a particularly hysterical piece which
alleged that the document Craig Neidorf (into whose case we had entered a
supporting amicus brief) had published was a computer virus capable of
bringing down the emergency phone system for the entire country. In fact,
the text file which Neidorf distributed dealt with the bureaucratic
procedures of 911 administration in the BellSouth region and contained
nothing which could be used to crack a system. Indeed, it contained
nothing which could not be easily obtained through by legal means.

We persevered. Our first major break came in late July. Thanks in part to
the expertise of John Nagel, a witness we introduced to Neidorf's lawyer,
the government was forced to abandon its case against Neidorf after 4 days
in Chicago's Federal Court.

Although our briefs supporting Neidorf's activities under the 1st Amendment
were not admitted, it became apparent, before such loftier matters could
even be broached, that the Secret Service had indicted him with no clear
understanding of the purpose or availability of the document he had
distributed. Like Agent Baxter, they knew too little to critically examine
the misinformation they had been given by the corporate masters, in this
case, officials at Bellcore.

Following the resolution of the Neidorf case, and, to some extent because
of it, skepticism of EFF has moderated considerably. If anything, the most
recent press accounts of our activities have been almost fulsome in their
praise. Recent favorable coverage has appeared in the New York Times, The
Economist, Infoworld, Information Week, PCweek, and Boston Magazine.

Since July, we have been absurdly busy on numerous fronts: We've worked on
raising public awareness of the issues at stake. We are organizing legal
responses to the original and continuing intemperance of law enforcement.
We have worked on the political front, developing and lobbying for rational
computer security legislation. We have started to create a network of

interested experts on computer security, intellectual property,
telecommunications policy, and international information rights. And
lately we've been attending to the organizational demands of the non-profit
equivalent of a hyper-successful computer startup.

The following is a cursory digest of these activities.

The EFF in Public

We believe that critical to taming the electronic frontier is creating a
sense of the stakes among both the computer literate and the general
public. We have combined public appearances, that incredibly blunt
instrument, the Media, and electronic interaction to cover a lot of
consciousness since July. It's a good thing Mitch has that airplane.

We have continued to build a constituency within the computing community,
convening small gatherings of computer professionals from across the
hacker/suit spectrum. Mitch, Harvey, and I have also addressed larger
forums such as the CPSR Annual Meeting, the International Information
Integrity Institute meeting on computer security, the Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of Science and
Engineering, Stewart Alsop's Agenda '91, MacHack, the Boston Computer
Society, Ars Electronica, the Kennedy School of Government, and numerous
others.

We have done more press interviews and call-in radio shows than I can
remember. Woz appeared on Good Morning America with Assistant Arizona AG
(and Operation Sundevil architect) Gail Thackery. EFF has appeared
prominently in national publications ranging from Newsweek to Spin, most of
the major daily newspapers, and nearly every computer trade publication
from Information Week to Mondo 2000. A writer for The New York Times
Magazine is currently at work on a major piece about EFF.

I have agreed to write a regular column on the Electronic Frontier for the
Communications of the ACM. And Mitch and I have been invited to submit
pieces to Scientific American, Issues in Science and Technology, and Whole
Earth Review.

We set up two Usenet newsgroups, comp.org.eff.news and comp.org.eff.talk.
eff.news is moderated by Glenn Tenney and contains a selection of the best
articles posted in eff.talk. We began an EFF forum on the WELL (which soon
became among the most active conferences there, right behind Sex and the
Grateful Dead). We are setting up our own USENET node on the Net, eff.org,
with a Sun IV in our Cambridge office and the guidance of volunteer sysop
Spike Ilacqua. When fully operational, the machine will run the Caucus
conferencing system and should have a 56kb Internet connection. Finally,
we are investigating the possibility of setting up an EFF conference on
Compuserve.

We have read and personally generated over 4 megabytes of e-mail since
June. Lately, Jef Poskanzer has been maintaining the EFF's electronic
mailing list, which is now approaching 1000 names. Information distributed
through eff.news is also sent to the mailing list.

Concerned that our approach is a little too electronic, we are now trying
to connect more directly with folks who might be interested in EFF but who
are not online. Our newsletter, the first edition of which you now have in
your hands, is part of that effort. Primarily the work of Rick Doherty and
Dan Sokol, we intend to publish The EFFector a minimum of 4 times a year.

Finally, we are working with Jim Warren and a variety of groups to organize
a major international conference on Communications, Privacy, and Freedom to
be held in San Francisco in March of 1991. This gathering is being

designed to include citizens who are not technologically sophisticated.

Legal Issues

In the beginning, we had thought that most of our activities would either
take place in court or on the way there. While this hasn't quite been the
case, legal matters still require much of our time and by far the lion's
share of our expenditures.

Since the Neidorf case, most of our legal activity has been, of necessity,
low-profile. It is not strategically sound to announce lawsuits well in
advance of filing them, and, while there remains a lot of dubiously
confiscated equipment in constabulary storage, we are not going to
jeopardize our ends by telegraphing their means. We are currently
preparing cases on a variety of fronts, proceeding at the deliberate pace
characteristic of both geology and the law.

We remain primarily interested in those cases in which constitutional
issues are at stake. We are investigating incidents in which the First
Amendment rights of computer users may have been abridged, where searches
and seizures appear to have exceeded the authority of the Fourth Amendment,
where the government seems to have violated the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act, and where warrants have been issued with insufficient cause.
There is no shortage of legal opportunities here. The problem is picking
the best ones.

We are still working with two law firms, Silverglate and Good of Boston and
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky, and Lieberman of New York. We also
have dealings with Katten, Muchin & Zavis, the Chicago firm of Craig
Neidorf's attorney, Sheldon Zenner, and are considering offers of pro bono
assistance from a number of other firms around the country.

We recently hired Mike Godwin, a freshly minted Texas lawyer and USENET
adept, to sort through the factual and legal details of the many cases we

are being asked to intervene in. In his short time with us, he has
investigated several cases to determine their fit with EFF's constitutional
mission, their winnability, and their likelihood of producing clear legal
precedent.

We have a conference call of the EFF Legal Committee every other Wednesday
to discuss the current state of our cases and any new possibilities we
might wish to take on. The Legal Committee includes Mitch, Mike Godwin,
Harvey Silverglate, Sharon Beckman (of Silverglate & Good), Terry Gross (of
Rabinowitz, Boudin), and myself. We also have a private conference on the
WELL to distribute briefs, documents, and other legal information among the
members of the committee.

Mike Godwin is also EFF's liaison with a committee of the American Bar
Association which is investigating government actions in Operation
Sundevil. Chaired by Judge William McMahon of Ohio, the committee is
devising ABA guidelines for computer searches and seizures. EFF will have
an important role in establishing the committee's recommendations.

The Art of the Possible

Despite the patience it requires, the political process offers many
opportunities to pursue EFF's agenda. We have been working on two
different fronts to promote government rationality toward computer use, in
Washington, where we are working closely with the CPSR Civil Liberties and
Computing Project which we funded, and in Massachusetts where we have been
successful in developing model legislation.

CPSR, through the able efforts of Marc Rotenberg, has filed a lawsuit in
federal district court in the District of Columbia to obtain information

from the FBI about the monitoring of computer bulletin boards. This
follows similar efforts which forced the Treasury Department to admit that
the Secret Service was in fact monitoring BBS's.

Marc also testified before the Subcommittee on Technology and Law of the
Senate Judiciary Committee on S. 2476, the Computer Abuse Amendments Act of
1990\. CPSR supported the proposed addition of a recklessness misdemeanor
provision, calling attention to problems surrounding Operation Sun Devil
and the civil liberties issues raised by the investigation of computer
crime. The testimony was well received and widely reported in the press,
but Congress adjourned before passing the amendments.

In Massachusetts, we headed off a misguided computer crime bill which had
made it all the way to the desk of Governor Dukakis. Not only did we
persuade the Governor not to sign it, we organized an effort to rewrite the
bill for re-submission to the Massachusetts Legislature.

Sharon Beckman of Silverglate and Good drafted much of the new legislation,
which, if it passes, will serve as a model law for other states to emulate.
The new bill draws a clear distinction between computer trespass and
actual malice, proposing appropriate penalties for each. It also instructs
law enforcement agencies to be aware of the constitutional issues involved
in the investigation of computer crime.

Intellectual Property

This phrase has always sounded like an oxymoron to me. "Property" seems to
imply something more tangible than the mysterious stuff to which the term
applies, and it is from this ambiguity that arises much of the difficulty

along the electronic frontier. Just as limited bandwidth was the excuse
for applying censorship to broadcast media, it appears that the zealous
protection of intellectual property presents the greatest threat to free
digital expression.

For this reason, the definition and regulation of intellectual property is
a matter of great concern to EFF. However, we recognize that the
established canon of copyright and patent law is so fundamentally
inadequate to the demands of the Information Age that any effort to made a
significant difference in this area could consume all of EFF's resources.

Nevertheless, both Mitch and I intend to devote a lot of our personal time
to this issue. Mitch is especially well situated to make a difference. As
the author of the most successful (as well the most pirated) piece of
software in history, he has an important and credible voice amid the babble
of obsolete legalisms which surrounds the discussion of intellectual
property.

Marc Rotenberg is also working in this area. He attended the first meeting
of the Office of Technology Assessment panel on intellectual property.
Marc recommended that the OTA give careful consideration to the public
interest issues that might be raised by various forms of intellectual
property protection. The OTA has agreed to host a workshop on this topic
and has asked CPSR to prepare a short report.

Designing the Future Net

Sometimes it seems as if all of humanity is engaged in a Great Work...which
I imagine to be the hard-wiring of human consciousness. It is as if we
must literally connect ourselves electronically before we can appreciate
the connections which have always existed.

As exalted as such an undertaking might sound, the actual wiring process is
as tedious as any endeavor I can imagine. In addition to building hard
infrastructure...fiber optic cabling, link stations, and microwave
towers...the policy process surrounding telecommunications and information
delivery is arcane and convoluted beyond ability of any but the most
dedicated student to understand it. As a consequence, those large
institutions with a clear financial stake are the only entities which have
taken the trouble.

This leaves the average citizen with no voice in the some of the most
important decisions about how his future will be designed. Fortunately,
Mitch is also willing to take these issues on. Working with Jerry Berman
of the ACLU, Mitch and the EFF intend to create an "information consumers
communications policy forum" to bring together the Baby Bells, AT&T, other
telcos, the FCC, newspaper publishers, online information services, and
other stakeholders to discuss how their vision of the future of the Net
serves the public interest.

Mitch is also meeting with Net hackers and visionaries to begin to develop
a sense of where we want to go and how we might get there. His own vision:
"a reliable digital network available to everyone with no restrictions on
content and policies which promote information entrepreneurship." He will
be devoting a lot of his time to this issue. Again, EFF will support his
efforts to the extent it can do so without diminishing its effectiveness on
the civil liberties front.

An Information Bill of Rights

When we first defined the mission of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we
saw our task as assuring the application of the U.S. Constitution to
digital media. And this remains much of what we are about.

However, information has little natural regard for national borders or
local ordinances. Cyberspace is transnational. During the tsunami of
e-mail which Crime & Puzzlement elicited, there were many items from

foreign countries. Their authors wanted to know how they could protect or
establish their rights of free expression. And I had no idea what to tell
them.

The question arose again at Esther Dyson's recent East-West Technology
Conference in Budapest which Mitch and I attended. EFF was well-known
among the Soviets at this meeting, some of whom were already involved in
drafting what they called an Information Bill of Rights. (One young Moscow
programmer had managed to hack together an Internet connection through
Finland in order to contact me.)

Like intellectual property and telecom policy, the development of
international principles of free digital speech is a large angel to wrestle
with. We will have to be careful not to allow this immense task to divert
EFF from its specific legal agenda. But neither can we ignore the fact
that Cyberspace is hardly an American territory.

Nuts and Bolts

The Electronic Frontier Foundation grew from an effort to fight a specific
legal brushfire into a full-fledged Cause much faster than we could have
imagined. And, like any explosive start-up, it spends a lot of time
playing catch-up.

Electronically amplified, Mitch and I were able to personally conduct much
of EFF's business in the first few months of operations. But gradually we
had to confront the fact that while the Net is very broad, it is also quite
shallow. Without even a sense of their physical location, we have been
unable to marshal the hundreds of people who have e-mailed us with their
volunteered services. Also, we found ourselves administering a significant
cash-flow in both donations and expenditures. (By year's end, EFF will
have spent around $220,000. Our tentative 1991 budget predicts expenses of
almost half a million.)

So, despite a mutual terror of bureaucracy and organizational sclerosis, we
have started to adopt some institutional trappings.

First, in order to satisfy the requirements for a 501c3 tax status (which
we should have in about six months), we found that we needed something more
substantial than two guys with modems. Thus, on October 9, we held our
first official board meeting and formally elected Stewart Brand, Steve
Wozniak, and John Gilmore to join us as board members.

And we have started to take on staff. In addition to the affore-mentioned
Mike Godwin, we have contracted Judith Nies to come in to the office once a
week and work on correspondence the requests for information which come in
via the telephone and mail.

We have also advertised for an Executive Director (see notice elsewhere in
this issue). We hope to hire this individual soon and expect him/her to
attend to the many administrative details which have begun to gobble our
time. (Mitch has been especially swamped.) Upon his/her arrival, we will
be able to devise policies regarding membership, coordination of
volunteers, local chapters, and other organizational dimensions.

Finally, after many months as
[eff@eff.org](Ómailto:eff@eff.orgÓ) we have established a
location in the material world. Our office is at:

The Electronic Frontier Foundation

155 Second St.

Cambridge, MA 02141

(617)864-0665

(617)864-0866 fax

We are determined that EFF will remain an agile, swift-moving sort of
outfit. We will adopt any new bureaucratic manifestations with the
greatest skepticism. But we are being bombarded with many legitimate
requests for assistance, advice, and information. In order to respond
rapidly and appropriately, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has had to bec
ome an institution. One method by which we hope to maintain organizational
lightness involves keeping a clear distinction between strategy and
tactics.

On the strategic level, EFF has a very broad mission involving such
amorphous endeavors as defining intellectual property, helping establish a
transnational culture of information, designing telecommunications policy,
sponsoring humane software design... civilizing Cyberspace. With an
appropriate sense of their limitations, the board members will remain
responsible for these matters.

This will prevent the staff's losing tactical focus on more tangible action
items like litigation, political action, communicating through the press
and across the Net, and organizational care and feeding.

The Kicker

The problem with history is that it keeps happening. Today, as I was
working on this EFF mini-biography, I learned that Mitch has just had his
fingerprints subpoenaed by the FBI. Turns out they are now examining the
NuPrometheus distribution disks for fingerprints and want to be able to
sort his out. Or, perhaps, search for their appearance on other disks...

So the Wheels of Justice grind blindly on. And we will go on trying to
prevent anyone's being ground up in them.





A Plain Text on Crypto Policy
=============================

For the October, 1993  Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

The field of cryptography, for centuries accustomed to hermetic isolation within a culture as obscure as its own puzzles, is going public. People who thought algorithms were maybe something you needed to dig rap music are suddenly taking an active interest in the black arts of crypto.

We have the FBI and NSA to thank for this. The FBI was first to arouse public concerns about the future of digital privacy with its  injection of language year before last into a major Senate anti-crime bill (SB 266) which would have registered the congressional intent that all providers of digitized communications should provide law enforcement with analog access to voice and data transmissions of their subscribers.

When this was quietly yanked in committee, they returned with a proposed bill called Digital Telephony. If passed, it would have essentially called a halt to most American progress in telecommunications until they could be assured of their continued ability to wiretap. Strange but true.

They were never able to find anyone in Congress technologically backward enough to introduce this oddity for them, but they did elevate public awareness of the issues considerably.

The National Security Agency, for all its (unknown but huge) budget, staff, and MIPS, has about as much real world political experience as the Order of Trappists and has demonstrated in its management of cryptology export policies the maddening counter-productivity that is the usual companion of inexperience.

The joint bunglings of these two agencies were starting to infuriate a lot of people and institutions who are rarely troubled by Large Governmental Foolishness in the Service of Paranoia. Along with all the usual paranoids, of course.

Then from the NSA's caverns in Fort Meade, Maryland there slouched a chip called Clipper.

For those of you who just tuned in (or who tuned out early), the Clipper Chip...now called Skipjack owing to a trademark conflict...is a hardware encryption device that NSA designed under Reagan-Bush. In April it was unveiled by the Clinton Administration and proposed for both governmental and public use. Installed in phones or other telecommunications tools, it would turn any conversation into gibberish for all but the speaker and his intended listener, using a secret military algorithm.

Clipper/Skipjack is unique, and controversial, in that it also allows the agents of government to listen under certain circumstances. Each chip contains a key that is split into two parts immediately following manufacture. Each half is then placed in the custody of some trusted institution or "escrow agent."

If, at some subsequent time, some government agency desires to legally listen in on the owner of the communications device in which the chip has been placed, it would present evidence of "lawful authority" to the escrow holders. They will reveal the key pairs, the agency will join them, and begin listening to the subject's unencrypted conversations.

(Apparently there are other agencies besides law enforcement who can legally listen to electronic communications.  The government has evaded questions about exactly who will have access to these keys, or for that matter, what, besides an judicial warrant, constitutes the "lawful authority" to which they continually refer.)

Clipper/Skipjack was not well received. The blizzard of anguished ASCII it summoned forth on the Net has been so endlessly voluble and so painstaking in its "How-many-Cray-Years-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-Clipper-Chip"technical detail that I would guess all but the real cypherpunks are by now data-shocked into listlessness and confusion.

Indeed, I suspect that even many readers of this publication...a group with prodigious capacity for assimilating the arid and obscure...are starting to long for the days when their knowledge of cryptography and the public policies surrounding it was limited enough to be coherent.

So I almost hesitate to bring the subject up. Yet somewhere amid this racket, decisions are being made that will profoundly affect your future ability to communicate without fear. Those who would sacrifice your liberty for their illusions of public safety are being afforded some refuge by the very din of opposition.

In the hope of restoring both light and heat to the debate, I'm going to summarize previous episodes, state a few conclusions I've drawn about the current techno-political terrain, and recommend positions you might When I first heard about Clipper/Skipjack, I thought it might not be such a bad idea. This false conclusion was partly due to the reality distorting character of the location...I was about fifty feet away from the Oval Office at the time...but it also seemed like one plausible approach to what may be the bright future of crime in the Virtual Age.

I mean, I can see what the Guardian Class is worried about. The greater part of business is already being transacted in Cyberspace. Most of the money is there. At the moment, however, most of the monetary bits in there are being accounted for. Accounting is digital, but cash is not.

It is imaginable that, with the widespread use of digital cash and encrypted monetary exchange on the Global Net, economies the size of America's could appear as nothing but oceans of alphabet soup. Money laundering would no longer be necessary. The payment of taxes might become more or less voluntary. A lot of weird things would happen after that...

I'm pretty comfortable with chaos, but this is not a future I greet without reservation.

So, while I'm not entirely persuaded that we need to give up our future privacy to protect ourselves from drug dealers, terrorists, child molesters, and un-named military opponents (the Four Horsemen of Fear customarily invoked by our protectors), I can imagine bogeymen whose traffic I'd want visible to authority.

Trouble is, the more one learns about Clipper/Skipjack, the less persuaded he is that it would do much to bring many actual Bad Guys under scrutiny.

As proposed, it would be a voluntary standard, spread mainly by the market forces that would arise after the government bought a few tons of these chips for their own "sensitive but unclassified" communications systems. No one would be driven to use it by anything but convenience. In fact, no one with any brains would use it if he were trying to get away with anything.

In fact, the man who claims to have designed Clipper's basic specs, Acting NIST Director Ray Kammer, recently said,  "It's obvious that anyone who uses Clipper for the conduct of organized crime is dumb." No kidding. At least so long as it's voluntary.

Under sober review, there mounted an incredibly long list of reasons to think Clipper/Skipjack might not be a fully-baked idea. In May, after a month of study, the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a coalition of some 40 companies and organizations chaired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent the White House 118 extremely tough questions regarding Clipper, any five of which should have been sufficient to put the kibosh on it.

The members of this group were not a bunch of hysterics. It includes DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sun, MCI, Microsoft, Apple, and AT&T (which was also, interestingly enough, the first company to commit to putting Clipper/Skipjack in its own products).

Among the more troubling of their questions:

o       Who would the escrow agents be?

o       What are Clipper's likely economic impacts, especially in regard to export of American digital products?

o       Why is its encryption algorithm secret and why should the public have confidence in a government-derived algorithm that can't be privately tested?

o       Why is Clipper/Skipjack being ram-rodded into adoption as a government standard before completion of an over-all review of U.S. policies on cryptography?

o       Why are the NSA, FBI, and NIST stone-walling Freedom of Information inquiries about Clipper/Skipjack? (In fact, NSA's response has been, essentially, "So? Sue us.")

o       Assuming Clipper/Skipjack becomes a standard, what happens if the escrow depositories are compromised?

o       Wouldn't these depositories also become targets of opportunity for any criminal or terrorist organization that wanted to disrupt US. law enforcement?

o       Since the chip transmits its serial number at the beginning of each connection, why wouldn't it render its owner's activities highly visible through traffic analysis (for which government needs no warrant)?

o       Why would a foreign customer buy a device that exposed his conversations to examination by the government of the United States?

o       Does the deployment and use of the chip possibly violate the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution?

o       In its discussions of Clipper/Skipjack, the government often uses the phrase "lawfully authorized electronic surveillance." What, exactly, do they mean by this?

o       Is it appropriate to insert classified technology into either the public communications network or into the general suite of public technology standards?

And so on and so forth. As I say, it was a very long list.  On July 29, John D. Podesta, Assistant to the President and White House Staff Secretary (and, interestingly enough, a former legal consultant to EFF and Co-Chair of the Digital Privacy Working Group), responded to these questions. He actually answered few of them.

Still un-named, undescribed, and increasingly unimaginable were the escrow agents. Questions about the inviolability of the depositories were met with something like, "Don't worry, they'll be secure. Trust us."

There seemed a lot of that in Podesta's responses. While the government had convened a panel of learned cryptologists to examine the classified Skipjack algorithm, it had failed to inspire much confidence among the crypto establishment, most of whom were still disinclined to trust anything they couldn't whack at themselves. At the least, most people felt a proper examination would take longer than the month or so the panel got. After all, it took fifteen years to find a hairline fissure in DES .

But neither Podesta nor any other official explained why it had seemed necessary to use a classified military algorithm for civilian purposes. Nor were the potential economic impacts addressed. Nor were the concerns about traffic analysis laid to rest.

But as Thomas Pynchon once wrote, "If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers." Neither asked nor answered in all of this was the one question that kept coming back to me: Was this trip really necessary?

For all the debate over the details, few on either side seemed to be approaching the matter from first principles. Were the enshrined threats...drug dealers, terrorists, child molesters, and foreign enemies...sufficiently and presently imperiling to justify fundamentally compromising all future transmitted privacy?

I mean...speaking personally now...it seems to me that America's greatest health risks derive from the drugs that are legal, a position the statistics overwhelmingly support. And then there's terrorism, to which we lost a total of two Americans in 1992, even with the World Trade Center bombing, only 6 in 1993. I honestly can't imagine an organized ring of child molesters, but I suppose one or two might be out there. And the last time we got into a shooting match with another nation, we beat them by a kill ratio of about 2300 to 1.

Even if these are real threats, was enhanced wire-tap the best way to combat them? Apparently, it hasn't been in the past. Over the last ten years the average total  nation-wide number of admissible state and federal wire-taps has numbered less than 800. Wire-tap is not at present a major enforcement tool, and is far less efficient than the informants, witnesses, physical evidence, and good old fashioned detective work they usually rely on.

(It's worth noting that the World Trade Center bombing case unraveled, not through wire-taps, but with the discovery of the axle serial number on the van which held the explosives.)

Despite all these questions, both unasked and unanswered, Clipper continues (at the time of this writing) to sail briskly toward standardhood, the full wind of government bearing her along.

On July 30, NIST issued a request for public comments on its proposal to establish Clipper/Skipjack as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).  All comments are due by September 28, and the government seems unwilling to delay the process despite the lack of an overall guiding policy on crypto. Worse, they are putting a hard sell on Clipper/Skipjack without a clue as to who might be escrow holders upon whose political acceptability the entire scheme hinges. Nor have they addressed the central question: why would a criminal use a key escrow device unless he were either very stupid...in which case he'd be easily caught anyway...or simply had no choice.

All this leads me to an uncharacteristically paranoid conclusion:

The Government May Mandate Key Escrow Encryption and Outlaw Other Forms. It is increasingly hard for me to imagine any other purpose for the Clipper/Skipjack operetta if not to prepare the way for the restriction of all private cryptographic uses to a key escrow system. If I were going to move the American people into a condition where they might accept restrictions on their encryption, I would first engineer the wide-spread deployment of a key escrow system on a voluntary basis, wait for some blind sheik to slip a bomb plot around it and then say, "Sorry, folks this ain't enough, it's got to be universal."

Otherwise, why bother? Even its most ardent proponents admit that no intelligent criminal would trust his communications to a key escrow device. On the other hand, if nearly all encrypted traffic were Skipjack-flavored, any transmission encoded by some other algorithm would stick out like a licorice Dot.

In fact, the assumption that Cyberspace will roar one day with Skipjack babble lies behind the stated reason for the secrecy for the algorithm. In their Interim Report, the Skipjack review panel puts it this way:

Disclosure of the algorithm would permit the construction of devices that fail to properly implement the LEAF \[or Law Enforcement Access Field\], while still interoperating with legitimate SKIPJACK devices.  Such devices would provide high quality cryptographic security without preserving the law enforcement access capability that distinguishes this cryptographic initiative.

In other words, they don't want devices or software out there that might use the Skipjack algorithm without depositing a key with the escrow holders. (By the way, this claim is open to question. Publishing Skipjack would not necessarily endow anyone with the ability to build an interoperable chip.)

Then there was the conversation I had with a highly-placed official of the National Security Council in which he mused that the French had, after all, outlawed the private use of cryptography, so it weren't as though it couldn't be done. (He didn't suggest that we should also emulate France's policy of conducting espionage on other countries' industries, though wide-spread international use of Clipper/Skipjack would certainly enhance our ability to do so.)

Be that as it may, France doesn't have a Bill of Rights to violate, which it seems to me that restriction of cryptography in America would do on several counts.

Mandated encryption standards would fly against the First Amendment, which surely protects the manner of our speech as clearly as it protects the content. Whole languages (most of them patois) have arisen on this planet for the purpose of making the speaker unintelligible to authority. I know of no instance where, even in the oppressive colonies where such languages were formed, that the slave-owners banned their use.

Furthermore, the encryption software itself is written expression, upon which no ban may be constitutionally imposed. (What, you might ask then, about the constitutionality of restrictions on algorithm export. I'd say they're being allowed only because no one ever got around to testing from that angle.)

The First Amendment also protects freedom of association. On several different occasions, most notably NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson and Talley vs. California, the courts have ruled that requiring the disclosure of either an organization's membership or the identity of an individual could lead to reprisals, thereby suppressing both association and speech. Certainly in a place like Cyberspace where everyone is so generally "visible," no truly private "assembly" can take place without some technical means of hiding the participants.

It also looks to me as if the forced imposition of a key escrow system might violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.

The Fourth Amendment prohibits secret searches. Even with a warrant, agents of the government must announce themselves before entering and may not seize property without informing the owner. Wire-taps inhabit a gray-ish area of the law in that they permit the secret "seizure" of an actual conversation by those actively eavesdropping on it. The law does not permit the subsequent secret seizure of a record of that conversation. Given the nature of electronic communications, an encryption key opens not only the phone line but the filing cabinet.

Finally, the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to reveal self-incriminating evidence. While no court has ever ruled on the matter vis a vis encryption keys, there seems something involuntarily self-incriminating about being forced to give up your secrets in advance. Which is, essentially, what mandatory key escrow would require you to do.

For all these protections, I keep thinking it would be nice to have a constitution like the one just adopted by our largest possible enemy, Russia. As I understand it, this document explicitly forbids governmental restrictions on the use of cryptography.

For the moment, we have to take our comfort in the fact that our government...or at least the parts of it that state their intentions...avows both publicly and privately that it has no intention to impose key escrow cryptography as a mandatory standard. It would be, to use Podesta's mild word, "imprudent."

But it's not Podesta or anyone else in the current White House who worries me. Despite their claims to the contrary, I'm not convinced they like Clipper any better than I do. In fact, one of them...not Podesta...called Clipper "our Bay of Pigs," referring to the ill-fated Cuban invasion cooked up by the CIA under Eisenhower and executed (badly) by a reluctant Kennedy Administration. The comparison may not be invidious.

It's the people I can't see who worry me. These are the people who actually developed Clipper/Skipjack and its classified algorithm, the people who, through export controls, have kept American cryptography largely to themselves, the people who are establishing in secret what the public can or cannot employ to protect its own secrets. They are invisible and silent to all the citizens they purportedly serve save those who sit the Congressional intelligence committees.

In secret, they are making for us what may be the most important choice that has ever faced American democracy, that is, whether our descendants will lead their private lives with unprecedented mobility and safety from coercion, or whether every move they make, geographic, economic, or amorous, will be visible to anyone who possesses whatever may then constitute "lawful authority."

Who Are the Lawful Authorities?

Over a year ago, when I first fell down the rabbit hole into Cryptoland, I wrote a Communications column called Decrypting the Puzzle Palace. In it, I advanced what I then thought a slightly paranoid thesis, suggesting that the NSA-guided embargoes on robust encryption software had been driven not by their stated justification (keeping good cryptography out of the possession of foreign military adversaries) but rather restricting its use by domestic civilians.

In the course of writing that piece, I spoke to a number of officials, including former CIA Director Stansfield Turner and former NSA Director Bobby Ray Inman, who assured me that using a military organization to shape domestic policy would be "injudicious" (as Turner put it), but no one could think of any law or regulation that might specifically prohibit the NSA from serving the goals of the Department of Justice.

But since then I've learned a lot about the hazy Post-Reagan/Bush lines between law enforcement and intelligence. They started redrawing the map of authority early in their administration with Executive Order 12333, issued on December 4, 1981. (Federal Register #: 46 FR 59941)

This sweeping decree defines the duties and limitations of the various intelligence organizations of the United States and contains the following language:

1.4  The Intelligence Community.  The agencies within the Intelligence Community shall...conduct intelligence activities necessary for the... protection of the national security of the United States, including: ...

(c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of activities to protect against, intelligence activities directed against the United States, international terrorist and international narcotics activities, and other hostile activities directed against the United States by foreign powers, organizations, persons, and their agents;  (Italics Added)

Further, in Section 2.6, Assistance to Law Enforcement Authorities, agencies within the Intelligence Community are authorized to...participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers, or international terrorist or narcotics activities.

In other words, the intelligence community was specifically charged with investigative responsibility for international criminal activities in the areas of drugs and terrorism.

Furthermore, within certain fairly loose guidelines, intelligence organizations are "authorized to collect, retain or disseminate information concerning United States persons" that may include "incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local or foreign laws."

Given that the NSA monitors a significant portion of all the electronic communications between the United States and other countries, the opportunities for "incidentally obtaining" information that might incriminate Americans inside America are great.

Furthermore, over the course of the Reagan/Bush administration, the job of fighting the War on Some Drugs gradually spread to every element of the Executive Branch.

Even the Department of Energy is now involved. At an Intelligence Community conference last winter I heard a proud speech from a DOE official in which he talked about how some of the bomb-designing supercomputers at Los Alamos had been turned to the peaceful purpose of sifting through huge piles of openly available data...newspapers, courthouse records, etc....in search of patterns that would expose drug users and traffickers. They are selling their results to a variety of "lawful authorities," ranging from the Southern Command of the U.S. Army to the Panamanian Defense Forces to various County Sheriff's Departments.

"Fine," you might say, "Drug use is a epidemic that merits any cure." But I would be surprised if there's anyone who will read this sentence who has broken no laws whatever. And it's anybody's guess what evidence of other unlawful activities might be "incidentally obtained" by such a wide net as DOE is flinging.

The central focus that drugs and terrorism have assumed within the intelligence agencies was underscored for me by a recent tour of the central operations room at the CIA. There, in the nerve center of American intelligence, were desks for Asia, Europe, North America, Africa and "Middle East/Terrorism," and "South America/Narcotics." These bogeymen are now the size of continents on the governmental map of peril.

Given this perception of its duties, the NSA's strict opposition to the export of strong cryptographic engines, hard or soft,  starts to make more sense. They are not, as I'd feared, so clue-impaired as to think their embargoes are denying any other nation access to good cryptography. (According to an internal Department of Defense analysis of crypto policy, it recently took 3 minutes and 14 seconds to locate a source code version of DES on the Internet.)

Nor do they really believe these policies are enhancing national security in the traditional, military sense of the word, where the U.S. is, in any case, already absurdly over-matched to any national adversary, as was proven during the Gulf War.

It's the enemies they can't bomb who have them worried, and they are certainly correct in thinking that the communications of drug traffickers and whatever few terrorists as may actually exist are more open to their perusal than would be the case in a world where even your grandmother's phone conversations were encrypted.

And Clipper or no Clipper, such a world would be closer at hand if manufacturers hadn't known than any device that embodies good encryption would not be fit for export.

But with Clipper/Skipjack, there is a lot that the combined forces of government will be able to do to monitor all aspects of your behavior without getting a warrant. Between the monitoring capacities of the NSA, the great data-sieves of the Department of Energy, and the fact that, in use, each chip would continually broadcast the whereabouts of its owner, the government would soon be able to isolate just about every perpetrator among us.

I assume you're neither a drug-user nor a terrorist, but are you ready for this? Is your nose that clean? Can it be prudent to give the government this kind of corrupting power?

I don't think so, but this is what will happen if we continue to allow the secret elements of government to shape domestic policy as though the only American goals that mattered were stopping terrorism (which seems pretty well stopped already) and winning the War on Some Drugs (which no amount of force will ever completely win).

Unfortunately, we are not able to discuss priorities with the people who are setting them, nor do they seem particularly amenable to any form of authority. In a recent discussion with a White House official, I asked for his help in getting the NSA to come out of its bunker and engage in direct and open discussions about crypto embargoes, key escrow, the Skipjack algorithm, and the other matters of public interest.

"I'll see what we can do," he said.

"But you guys are the government," I protested. "Surely they'll do as you tell them."

"I'll see what we can do," he repeated, offering little optimism.

That was months ago. In the meantime, the NSA has not only remained utterly unforthcoming in public discussions of crypto policy, they have unlawfully refused to comply with any Freedom of Information Act requests for documents in this area.

It is time for the public to reassert control over their own government. It is time to demand that public policy be made in public by officials with names, faces, and personal accountability.

When and if we are able to actually discuss crypto policy with the people who are setting it, I have a list of objectives that I hope many of you will share. There are as follows:

1.      There should no law restricting any use of cryptography by private citizens.

2.      There should be no restriction on the export of cryptographic algorithms or any other instruments of cryptography.

3.      Secret agencies should not be allowed to drive public policies.

4.      The taxpayer's investment in encryption technology and related mathematical research should be made available for public and scientific use.

5.      The government should encourage the deployment of wide-spread encryption.

6.      While key escrow systems may have purposes, none should be implemented that places the keys in the hands of government.

7.      Any encryption standard to be implemented by the government should developed in an open and public fashion and should not employ a secret algorithm.

And last, or perhaps, first...

8.      There should be no broadening of governmental access to private communications and records unless there is a public consensus that the risks to safety outweigh the risks to liberty and will be effectively addressed by these means.

If you support these principles, or even if you don't, I hope you will participate in making this a public process. And there are a number of actions you can take in that regard.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a request for public comments on its proposal to establish the "Skipjack"key-escrow system as a Federal Information Processing Standard.  You've got until September 28 to tell them what you think of that. Comments on the NIST proposal should be sent to:

A Pretty Bad Problem
====================

Forward to PGP User's Guide by Phil Zimmerman

by John Perry Barlow

I love irony, and there lies in this book an irony as striking as any I know. It is this: that a computer program with the cute li'l ol' name of Pretty Good Privacy, written by an apparently unformidable gnome on a tight budget, now terrifies a security monolith that required half a century, uncounted billions of dollars, and the collective IQ's of a few thousand geniuses to develop.

This book and the software it describes, as brief and modest as its author, could very well be the root tendril that will grow into the National Security State and shatter it. It that is true, it's probably only a little hyperbolic to claim that you are holding a work as liberating as Common Sense, or, viewed through another set of bunker slits, as socially disruptive as Mein Kampf.

That doubtless sounds like a pretty disruptive statement itself, but it's not unconsidered. It seems to me that the combination of distributed digital technology and robust encryption has brought informatized society to a very sharp balance point between two lousy choices. On one side lies a technological foundation upon which the most massive totalitarianism could be built. On the other is a jungle in which any number of anarchic guerrillas might hide, upon whom little order could ever be imposed.

Assuming I'm not simply raving here, what leads me to this conclusion? Have things really gotten this weird? I honestly believe they may have.

At present most of us unwittingly leave a highly visible and nearly indelible trail in Cyberspace. Every time we make a modern financial transaction, use the telephone, send an e-mail message, we leave a path of bits from which anyone who's interested and properly equipped can assemble the detailed informational ghosts of our naked selves. If you have something you'd rather hide, don't hide it there.

Furthermore, the tools of surveillance are becoming far more sophisticated and conducive to centralization. Massive pattern recognition engines can be applied to the Net from, say, Washington, DC or Beijing, and specifically tuned to recognize certain kinds of activities.  Or even beliefs.

Any government that can automatically generate an intimate profile of every one of its citizens is a government endowed with a potential for absolute power that will eventually, to use Lord Acton's phrase, corrupt absolutely. Few civil liberties are likely to survive such capacities in the hands of the increasingly panicky authoritarians who run the embattled old bureaucracies of the Meat World.

Worse, their panic may be justified. An equally apprehensive and growing lot of cyber-libertarians now have at their disposal tools as unbalancingly powerful in their power to conceal as are the other side's in the service of revelation. One of these sabots goes by the mild name of Pretty Good Privacy.

Any number of citizens armed with PGP and such of its relations as digital cash and anonymous Net remailers can simply vanish from the governmental radar. They are at greater liberty than ever before to conduct any endeavor, including something that, as Phil frankly puts it at the beginning of this book, "shouldn't be illegal, but is." They can exempt themselves from taxes and yet maintain precise accounting records. In many ways, they can effectively resign from the community of the governed and enter a condition in which their actions ordered by conscience and culture alone.

And we may get a chance to find out just how well these are going to work as the primary templates for social order. There is no question that the patterns of unwritten code that arise from culture can work when the society in question is small, simple, or highly homogeneous.

For example, I come from a part of Wyoming where something like the Code of the West is still more important than the law or its instruments. It works pretty well. I don't have a key to my house, and through many years in the cattle business, I signed few contracts and was never knowingly cheated.

Something similar obtains in Japan, a much larger and more complex society which is nevertheless monocultural enough to resist chaos far more by general consent than by any order that police might enforce. And it is nearly crime free.

The emergent social orders of both Japan and Wyoming strongly support the idea that a less legalistic approach to the vicissitudes of life among the humans will work. What it less well known is whether it is possible to return to such a condition and whether truly diverse societies, such as we have in America, can ordered primarily by cultural norms.

Present evidence from both the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia is not so promising. After 70 years of the most heroic efforts to force order by imposed regulation, the great iron lid is off. And it is no Rousseauvian paradise to which the Russians have returned. They appear to be governed less by ethics than by criminals who would probably govern better if they were organized. Meanwhile the Balkans have returned to a state of tribal bloodshed that indicates that a strong sense of community, as expressed in cultural immune response, can be more disruptive than ordering.

But what are the choices? Do we allow matters to continue along their present technological trajectory, eventually endowing our government (and practically any marketing organization) with a magnifying window into the least of our lives? Do we allow ourselves to become intimately vulnerable to faceless bureaucracies to whom we will be incredibly well known yet remain faceless ourselves? We have gone too far that way already. But what can prevent a further tumble toward that dark horizon?

Do we try to hide our trails behind laws (favored by Europeans) that would define what might be the appropriate contents for a database? Do we endow government with the ability to define forbidden knowledge? I don't have much enthusiasm for this solution, which sounds to me rather like having a Peeping Tom install one's window blinds, I do not trust government with the ability to regulate information, especially information that contains within it such a long lever of control as those things about yourself you'd rather no one knew.

There are always special circumstances - grave matters of national security, they will insist. - in which it will seem obvious to our guardians that the sanctity of such laws is secondary to the greater public interest. Indeed, this is how we have been doing things in America for a long time. The Bill of Rights continues to apply only when the government feels no pain from its application.

It's a tough choice, but I think I would prefer to give people the means to control their own information. I think it is best that this virus of liberty is loose on the Net.

I would prefer to let my fellow citizens detach their economic transactions from their identities, despite the looming possibility that an anonymous economy will consider taxes voluntary. I would even rather extend to people the general condition of anonymity, hoping they will not use it much, knowing that without identity, there is little impetus for responsibility, and that without responsibility, the Social Contract is abrogated.

While I have focused so far on the ability of PGP to conceal, it is the area of identity that this software may make its most positive contribution. Even as digital technology can make us to visible, the absence of real bodies places a garment of ambiguity on everyone who interacts on the Net. If community requires identity, what is to be done about the ease by which the virtual can take on one another's identities?

To this dilemma, PGP provides an unambiguous solution: digital signature. Using the signing techniques enabled here, you can send and receive files with great assurance that they were generated by their purported authors and that their contents have not been altered. Once you are in the habit of authenticating your own words, no one may pretend to speak or act as you. You can be assured that you will only have to be responsible for your own actions and not the misdeeds of some phantom wearing your name.

For the rest of what PGP enables, ambivalence is the only appropriate response. Still, I would at least rather everyone know how to use the tools whose operation this book describes, though I fervently hope they will be somewhat circumspect about actually using them. Just as an armed populace may be more resistant to certain excesses of governmental zeal, so might a populace armed with the ultimate defensive  weapon, the ability to disappear, countervail against the all-seeing electronic eye.

We had best be armed with something. It seems certain to me that any government that can see everything we do all the time will sooner or later feel compelled to add omnipotence to omniscience, which are, in the Virtual Age, much the same thing anyway.

Maybe we will feel compelled to start using them. Maybe there will be anarchy, maybe even chaos. But chaos at least has an open architecture. Chaos has always been the native home of the infinitely possible. And among the possibilities I imagine is that human beings will turn out to be better, less paranoid, less worthy of inspiring paranoia, than many of us think.

In the end, it doesn't matter much what they think or I think. The genie of guerrilla cryptography is out of the bottle. No one, not even its maker, can stuff it back in or keep it within what America laughably calls its borders. The genie is all over the Net. It's in your hands as you hold this book. Summon it with a conscience. But be prepared to summon it if you must.





Across the Electronic Frontier
==============================

by: Mitchell Kapor and John Perry Barlow

     Electronic Frontier Foundation

     Washington, D.C.

     July 10, 1990

Over the last 50 years, the people of the developed world have begun to cross into a landscape unlike any which humanity has experienced before. It is a region without physical shape or form.  It exists, like a standing wave, in the vast web of our electronic communication systems. It consists of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought itself.

It is familiar to most people as the "place" in which a long-distance telephone conversation takes place.  But it is also the repository for all digital or electronically transferred information, and, as such, it is the venue for most of what is now commerce, industry, and broad-scale human interaction.  William Gibson called this Platonic realm "Cyberspace," a name  which has some currency among its present inhabitants.

Whatever it is eventually called, it is the homeland of the Information Age, the place where the future is destined to dwell.

In its present condition, Cyberspace is a frontier region, populated by the few hardy technologists who can tolerate the austerity of its savage computer interfaces, incompatible communications protocols, proprietary barricades, cultural and legal ambiguities, and general lack of useful maps or metaphors.

Certainly, the old concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context, based as they are on physical manifestation, do not apply succinctly in a world where there can be none.

Sovereignty over this new world is also not well defined.  Large institutions already lay claim to large fiefdoms, but most of the actual natives are solitary and independent, sometimes to the point of sociopathy.  It is, therefore, a perfect breeding ground for both outlaws and vigilantes.  Most of society has chosen to ignore the existence of this arising domain.  Every day millions of people use ATM's and credit cards, place telephone calls, make travel reservations, and access information of limitless variety. . . all without any perception of the digital machinations behind these transactions.

Our financial, legal, and even physical lives are increasingly dependent on realities of which we have only dimmest awareness.  We have entrusted the basic functions of modern existence to institutions we cannot name, using tools we've never heard of and could not operate if we had.

As communications and data technology continues to change and develop at a pace many times that of society, the inevitable conflicts have begun to occur on the border between Cyberspace and the physical world.

These are taking a wide variety of forms, including (but hardly limited to) the following:

Legal and Constitutional Questions

What is free speech and what is merely data?  What is a free press without paper and ink?  What is a "place" in a world without tangible dimensions?  How does one protect property which has no physical form and can be infinitely and easily reproduced?  Can the history of one's personal business affairs properly belong to someone else?  Can anyone morally claim to own knowledge itself?

These are just a few of the questions for which neither law nor custom can provide concrete answers.  In their absence, law enforcement agencies like the Secret Service and FBI, acting at the disposal of large information corporations, are seeking to create legal precedents which would radically limit Constitutional application to digital media.

The excesses of Operation Sun Devil are only the beginning of what threatens to become a long, difficult, and philosophically obscure struggle between institutional control and individual liberty.

Future Shock

Information workers, forced to keep pace with rapidly changing technology, are stuck on "the learning curve of Sisyphus." Increasingly, they find their hard-acquired skills to be obsolete even before they've been fully mastered. To a lesser extent, the same applies to ordinary citizens who correctly feel a lack of control over their own lives and identities.

One result of this is a neo-Luddite resentment of digital technology from which little good can come.  Another is a decrease in worker productivity ironically coupled to tools designed to enhance it. Finally, there is a spreading sense of alienation, dislocation, and helplessness in the general presence of which no society can expect to remain healthy.

The "Knows" and the "Know-Nots"

Modern economies are increasingly divided between those who are comfortable and proficient with digital technology and those who neither understand nor trust it.  In essence, this development disenfranchises the latter group, denying them any possibility of citizenship in Cyberspace and, thus, participation in the future.

Furthermore, as policy-makers and elected officials remain relatively ignorant of computers and their uses, they unknowingly abdicate most of their authority to corporate technocrats whose jobs do not include general social responsibility.  Elected government is thus replaced by institutions with little real interest beyond their own quarterly profits.

We are founding the Electronic Frontier Foundation to deal with these and related challenges.  While our agenda is ambitious to the point of audacity, we don't see much that these issues are being given the broad social attention they deserve.  We were forced to ask, "If not us, then who?"

In fact, our original objectives were more modest.  When we first heard about Operation Sun Devil and other official adventures into the digital realm, we thought that remedy could be derived by simply unleashing a few highly competent Constitutional lawyers upon the Government.  In essence, we were prepared to fight a few civil libertarian brush fires and go on about our private work.

However, examination of the issues surrounding these government actions revealed that we were dealing with the symptoms of a much larger malady, the collision between Society and Cyberspace.

We have concluded that a cure can lie only in bringing civilization to Cyberspace.  Unless a successful effort is made to render that harsh and mysterious terrain suitable for ordinary inhabitants, friction between the two worlds will worsen.  Constitutional protections, indeed the perceived legitimacy of representative government itself, might gradually disappear.

We could not allow this to happen unchallenged, and so arises the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  In addition to our legal interventions on behalf of those whose rights are threatened, we will:

Engage in and support efforts to educate both the general public and policymakers  about the opportunities and challengesed by developments in computing and telecommunications.

Encourage communication between the developers of technology, government, corporate officials, and the general public in which we might define the appropriate  metaphors and legal concepts for life in Cyberspace.

And, finally, foster the development of new tools which will endow non-technical  users with full and easy access to computer-based telecommunications.

One of us, Mitch Kapor, had already been a vocal advocate of more accessible software design and had given considerable thought to some of the challenges we now intend to meet.

The other, John Perry Barlow, is a relative newcomer to the world of computing (though not to the world of politics) and is therefore well-equipped to act as an emissary between the magicians of technology and the wary populace who must incorporate this magic into their daily lives.

While we expect the Electronic Frontier Foundation to be a creation of some longevity, we hope to avoid the sclerosis which organizations usually develop in their efforts to exist over time.  For this reason we will endeavor to remain light and flexible, marshalling intellectual and financial resources to meet specific purposes rather than finding purposes to match our resources.  As is appropriate, we will communicate between ourselves and with our constituents largely over the electronic Net, trusting self-distribution and self-organization to a much greater extent than would be possible for a more traditional organization.

We readily admit that we have our work cut out for us.  However, we are greatly encouraged by the overwhelming and positive response which we have received so far.  We hope the Electronic Frontier Foundation can function as a focal point for the many people of good will who wish to settle in a future as abundant and free as the present.





Barlow in Rockspace
===================

Date: Wed, 3 Jul 1996 19:31:30 +0200

From: John Perry Barlow <barlow@eff.org>

Subject: Barlow in Rockspace

Miracle and wonder. Dig the range of the Possible at the end of the 20th Century, Folks! Consider that I am now in the Business Class cabin of Swissair Flight 122 plunging toward Europe when only yesterday morning I was creeping up a talus slope in southern Utah at pace that took me 7 miles in the same time I will require tonight for the arc from Cincinnati to Zurich. We take these things too much for granted, I think.

There is a nearly full, though waning, moon off the starboard wing and we have just left what would be Maine were we not 35,000 feet above it. Where there is no place at all. "Here" in the stratosphere it is as uniform as Cyberspace and, as in Cyberspace, the only detail is within. I'm crossing a wide sweep of times zones, so time doesn't matter. And that irrelevance of such brief time is about the only present similarity to where I've been for the last week.

At first sunlight yesterday morning, I was in Another Time. I felt Neolithic as Og, living in a cave in the bottom of Utah's Dark Canyon, a fissure that forks like geological lightning through the cedar-speckled slickrock around Lake Powell. The bottom of Dark Canyon is almost three thousand feet below that deck.  It is deeper than it is wide. A mile back from its plunge, one might look across to buttes on the other side and never guess it was there.

If you are among the roughly 600 people who e-mailed me last week and to whom I've yet to respond, this is the reason for my digital silence. I was as profoundly off-line as I've been in a decade. Not only were there no volts or bits where I was, there was no time but Deep Time. No time but Now.

They stripped me of my wrist-watch before I went down there. I was prepared to be relieved of this albatross, my Powerbook. Indeed, that was part of the reason I went. To see how I would feel unwired. Terminally unterminated.

And I was prepared not to know what was going on in the larger world, as it's been awhile since anything that CNN would consider newsworthy has dropped my jaw. I was even prepared to have my fistfone blink to "no svc."(Though I did take it along as a totem and exposed it to various ritual humiliations in cairn-shrines over the course of the week.)

But I was not prepared to be relieved of the strange luxury of knowing that this particular moment was, say,  6:32:23 on June 29, 1996. Or whatever. I had no idea I had developed such a bad jones for named time.

So it was like so many of my other journeys. The real discovery was an unintended consequence of other research objectives. I set out, as I often do, trying to learn something about communications technology. Looking, in this case, to understand it better by its absence. And looking to understand myself, of course. Looking to see how resourceless I'd been rendered by Business Class and my other staple amenities.

I also went there to take a kind of ritual leave of my eldest daughter, Leah. She's just turned 14, and has recently acquired what is now, in the strictest physical sense, her adult self. I took her down there, spent a week with her, and left her there in the care and company of a wolfman-godfather, a poetic goddess, a Spanish girl, a skate-boarder, a rebel without a cause, and a would have been Deadhead doctor's boy. There was an additional complement of women who descended and emerged with me: a couple of wild 40-ish redheads from Tennessee, an the cat-woman wife of the wolfman.

This pair, the wolfman/cat-woman are Creighton and Annie King. I met them when he came to teach English in Pinedale a few years ago, having made a legend of himself in Utah and elsewhere as the kind of freak of nature who could literally \*run\* up things like the Grand Teton, bashing previous top-to-bottom records by multiple hours. A Harvard drop-out turned Alta ski patrolman, who turned himself at 40 to the time-honored and genuinely holy occupation of corrupting the youth with the truth. He got himself a teaching certificate and landed his first job at Pinedale High School. Where, in the course of two years, he managed to change so many young lives for the better that the community had no choice but to expel him.

During their short tenure in Pinedale I developed a history with the Kings that is another tale, but they were certainly the right people rip me from my bath of jet-fuel and IP packets and take me down into the heat and stone.

I was plenty ready. There's been a lot of velocity around me lately, and while I've often genuinely felt myself at peace in the eye of my own hurricane, while I've truly felt that Business Class could be my zendo, others have observed that living a life where the average 24 hour a day speed almost never falls below 50 mph might violates the laws of both physics and biology. Not to mention common sense.

And all these tools of mine! I been feeling impaired by my enhancements. Weird as Edward Scissorhands, though not as visibly so. There is a cartoon in the current Utne Reader in which a laptop and cell phone are dashing down the street shouting "Which way did he go?" while their desperate owner cowers behind a corner. I can relate. (Though you, Cliff Stoll, should take no comfort from this admission.)

Anyway. After they were ejected from Pinedale, the Kings went to teach at a prep school in central Mormonia called Wasatch Academy. This school runs a summer program called Nature Writers that takes kids down into Edward Abby Country with a notepad, a minimal amount of adult supervision, and plenty of trail mix. It's Outward Bound for the aspiring young writer.

The daughters and I became genuinely familial with the Kings during their low pass through Pinedale, and they with us, so there was no presumption in their setting their own agenda for me and Leah.

They wanted to get me off time and her off me and, in only a week, they took us a long way toward that goal. The hook was a scholarship to the program for Leah on the condition that I would come speak at Wasatch. Having done that, I drove to a place in the desert, parked my Corrado, shouldered a back-pack for the first time in my life, and headed toward the lip of Dark Canyon. Annie stopped me. "Let's have that  wrist-watch, Big Boy." she said.

Unless I'm mistaken, this is the first time I've taken off my watch for more than 10 hours in the last 30 years. While I've been fancying myself to be asynchratic, it may just be that I'm only chronically tardy and am actually as time-dominated as the next white guy.

>From that moment forward, we plunged into a past where the sort of time one might measure on one's wrist is just silly. The Navajo sandstone formations that lie at the roof of Dark Canyon were blown into dunes there many tens of millions of years ago and the shales that lies along much of its bottom were cracking mudflats back when brachiopods, mosses, and scallops were about the most interesting thing Life could come up with, hundreds of millions of years before that.

Almost immediately, time opened up to me like sound to the blind. In the absence of my measuring device, the entire time spectrum became palpable. My first thoughts regarded the brief temporal gap between myself and Leah, as she strode out before me on her long, capable doe-legs. Her fresh youth and my lumbering age. As I wallowed along beneath my pack, my hip sockets immediately filled with fire, my knees bloody rubber at once. The Kings, the other kids, the giddy boys, the girl from Madrid, the doctor's son from Virginia, surged along beside her. And I hobbled over the slick rock, wondering if I hadn't for once bitten off more than I could chew.

But I didn't. I survived it. Not only did I descend into that paradise for lizards, but I spent a week in continuous motion along the Z-axis under a biblical sun, living in a world made not merely of atoms, but of \*hard\* atoms. Rockspace.  And yesterday morning I hauled my fat old self back up those 3000 feet in temperatures that hit a hundred degrees F. and did not sustain a massive coronary thrombosis.

In the meantime, I had ridden a flashflood to the Colorado River, civilized and made my own a cave previously inhabited by bats and moths bigger than bats with eyes that glowed red in my headlamp, built a sweatlodge of willows and tamarisk, watched the hallucinogenic Datura plant unfurl its wicked flowers in the light of a Blue Moon. And, more than anything else, learned about kinds of time that are both entirely local and entirely general. At the same "time." Now and forever.

But the first gap remained. I'm back out of there, but my legs look like I've been trying to yo-yo with a circular grinder while Leah's, last seen, were unmarked. Spared damage by the invisible shield of her grace.

Such a human eternity there is between the father and the daughter who's still down there as I blast toward another yet European opportunity for paternal windbaggery. Leah was born on Father's Day, 1982 and taught me unconditional love. She has always been a secret child of depths unplumbed by either of us, but especially bonded to me by her being my first-born. And by her genuinely terrifying beauty.

Even though she has never found much voice for her feelings, they would rise up in the way she felt when I hugged her, and since I am such a physically communicative person, that was sufficient. Then, a couple of months ago, as she thundered into formal adolescence, she froze in my embrace. As one might expect. Suddenly, my touch was fearsome to her and the main channel of our emotional communication was severed. A long awaited time had come.

Years ago, when she was about 5 I think, we spent the day in a mall in LA. When we returned to where we were staying, she appeared to be in a meditative, even dismal, frame of mind.

"What is it?" I wanted to know?

"I can't tell you."

"Oh, come on now, Leah. Surely you can tell me."

"No. I 'specially can't tell you."

"Then you'd \*better\* tell me," I said.

After much negotiation, she revealed her trouble.

"Daddy," she confessed, eyes misting, "I watched the teenagers with their parents n that mall today and I realized that someday I would be a teenager and I wouldn't like you anymore."

I'm not quite saying we've reached such a point as that, but it's close enough that I knew it was time I backed well away and left her to probe her own destiny with less direction from me.

In other words, it was time for me to take her out into the wilderness and leave her there. I know that if we lived in a more complete society than this patchwork we suffer now, if we were Quakiutl or K!ung or even practicing Mormon, we might have some more generally accepted ritual for such things. But the best contemporary Generica can offer in this department is a version of the Mickey Mouse Club that increasingly resembles MTV, so I know better than to look to my own culture for guidance.

Better it seemed to turn to that ultimate tabula rasa, the Desert. Better to go to a place where most of the tools upon which my culture bases itself would be useless. So we returned to the baseline of civilization to see what might naturally gin itself up from there.

The first night in the bottom of the Canyon we all camped together, but when I moved half a mile downstream on the second day and Leah elected to stay behind under the overhang she'd picked out - rattlesnakes notwithstanding - I knew the process was underway. And I knew it all the more the next morning when she ghosted into my cave, with all but her wide, white eyes covered in black river mud. A wild pagan girl, entirely her own.

A little later the thunderstorm we'd earlier heard thrashing around up-canyon yielded its consequences. Within a few minutes, the clear water that fell gently into the pool below my cave had turned chocolate and cubed its volume. It roared brown froth and stank. We jumped into it and rode it through falls and slides and rock-flesh sculptures of time without measurement until, some eons downstream, it emptied into irrefutable level that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had decreed with Glen Canyon Dam. Lake Powell.

We walked back in the moonlight, Leah catting along barefoot over the rubble. She was, at moments that day, the most beautiful sight of any sort that I have ever seen. I don't know how she feels about me now and I probably won't know for a few years. She'll have to find a new voice for her new heart and that will take time. In the meantime, I know how I feel about her. And that will have to do.

What else? My cave. I lived in a cave for a week. When I found it, I was puzzled that there were no signs of previous occupation since it seemed like such a perfect habitat, shelter from both thunderstorm and blasting mid-day furnace. Once I'd cleared some rubble, it even had a perfectly level berth along one side made of cool shale.

I busied myself tidying it up like some character from Wind in the Willows. I was surprised to find such a nesting instinct in myself. For what seems a long time, "settling in" hasn't amounted to more than figuring out the phone jacks and room service menu. Suddenly I felt like a vector of civilization, sweeping out silt with willow boughs, making rock granaries for food storage. I even asked the Tennessean redheads, who had almost immediately developed a superior aesthetic culture upstream, to come down and decorate the entrance, which they did.

What did I learn in my week away from measured time and electricity? I learned that the technological impulse is so strong in me that it doesn't matter how far I ratchet myself back, I will immediately set about to build what would end me up here in the 20th Century eventually.

I never completely quit jones-ing for time, though as the group of us moved into the simple present, time became more a philosophical than practical matter. We separated into five camps along a couple of miles of river and each camp rose at different times depending on how the sun hit them. Being sheltered most coolly, I generally rose last and proceeded forth languidly, counting on moonlight for the biggest part of my day.

But the thrust to build was insistent. By the third day, I found myself weaving together a sweat lodge like a giant basket, trying out various materials - cat-tails, willow shoots, tall grass - as binding twine. I felt like Robinson Crusoe or a member of the Swiss Family Robinson, an early moment in the thrust of Manifest Destiny.

I'm glad to be back in my usual jet-fuel burning, electricity sucking, data bathing plunge. I'm glad to back on-line and I'm even digging digging out from underneath my accumulated messages. I'm even glad to be in Dusseldorf tonight, if you can believe that.

But I think I also need to make a more regular journey to where time is measured by geological periods rather than megahertz. I recommend Rockspace.

Barlow, Denning on the Clipper Chip scheme
==========================================

March 10, 1994 online debate between John Perry Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Dr. Dorothy Denning, over the Clipper Chip scheme, from the Time Online forum of America On Line.

3/10/94 8:49:41 PM Opening "Chat Log 3/10/94 CLIPPER" for recording.

OnlineHost  : Good evening and welcome to the Time Online Odeon! Tonight we look from both sides at the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the National Security Agency developed and wants installed in every telephone, computer modem and fax machine.

OnlineHost  : In his article in the current issue of TIME, Philip Elmer-DeWitt writes: "The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm with a ''back door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that opens schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A ''secure'' phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization, be cracked by the government.

OnlineHost: "Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to keep tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper -- and a bill before Congress that would require phone companies to make it easy to tap the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will strip citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the computer age.

OnlineHost: "Lined up on one side are the three-letter cloak-and-dagger agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key policymakers in the Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly hard line on the encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a strange breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks."

RPTime: Lined up on our stage tonight are John Perry Barlow, Dr. Dorothy Denning and Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Barlow is co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes freedom in digital media. A recognized commentator on computer security, he is arguing against the Clipper Chip Dr. Denning is the chairperson of the Computer Science Department at Georgetown University. A leading expert on cryptography and data security, she favors the adoption of the Clipper Chip. Philip Elmer-DeWitt, TIME's technology editor will lead the questioning of our guests. Audience questions may be sent up using the Interact with Host function....Phil?

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, could you \*briefly\* make the case for why we need the key escrow encryption system.

DDenning: The government needs a new encryption standard to replace DES. They came up with a very strong algorithm called SKIPJACK. In making that available, they didn't want to do it in a way that could ultimately prove harmful to society. So they came up with the idea of key escrow so that if SKIPJACK were used to conceal criminal activity, they would be able to get access to the communications.

PhilipED: THanks. Mr. Barlow, could you briefly make the case \*against\* Clipper. We'll see if I can be brief. We oppose Clipper in large part because of the traffic analysis which it makes possible. We believe that it is in the functional nature of the chip as designed to greatly enhance the ability of government to observe who we are calling, when, and from where, all fairly automatically and centrally. We also oppose Clipper because of the many way in which we believe the escrow system could be compromised, by people and institutions both inside and outside of government.

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, what about John's contention that Clipper makes it easier to detect calling patterns.

DDenning: I don't buy this. First off, for law enforcement to access any communications, they need a court order. Even if the communications are encrypted. Second, with a court order, they can get access to call setup information and find out what other lines the subject of the investigation is talking to. This is of much more use than anything in the encrypted stream.

PhilipED: John, is Dorothy right that you need a court order for call set up info?

Barlow1: Dorothy, the government asked for and received over 100,000 calling records last year without a court order. I see nothing in the Clipper documents which indicates that they would require a court order to get this kind of information, which each chip would make readily available to the entire network.

DDenning: You need a court order to do implement pen registers and dialed number recorders in order to find out who is talking to whom.

Barlow1: Furthermore, my faith in court orders has been eroded by 30 years of government wiretap abuse.

PhilipED: Aren't we talking about three different hurdles here, one for a wiretap...

Barlow1: But that's only with the present system where putting a pen register on a line requires physical entrance to a phone company site.

PhilipED: One for a pen register (to track calling patterns in real time) and one for phone records.

RPTime: Let's take a question from the audience... How would you guarantee that this facility will never be misused? If you can't make that guarantee, why should a democratic society, with a prohibition against prior restraint, consent to this? John Barlow?

Barlow1: There are three different sources of information, as you say. But there are not three "hurdles." That sounds like a question for Dorothy. I don't think we should, obviously.

RPTime: Dr. Denning?

DDenning: First of all, there has been no evidence of widespread abuse of wiretaps since passage of the 1968 and 1978 wiretap statutes. Second, there are a lot of security mechanisms going into it to protect against abuse. Third, it will provide much greater protection against illegal wiretaps than we have now, since almost all phone conversations are in the clear. It will make virtually all illegal wiretaps impossible. Fourth, if for some reason it doesn't provide adequate protection, we can destroy the key databases and everyone will have absolute privacy against government wiretaps. I don't think our society will tolerate that kind of abuse.

PhilipED: John, isn't Dorothy right that you're better off with compromised encryption than none?

Barlow1: Gee, where to begin... First of all, there was plenty of abuse after 1968. Remember Watergate, Dorothy? Second, I believe that Clipper in the Net will dramatically \*enhance\* certain powers of...

DDenning: I was talking specifically about wiretap abuses. And there hasn't been any evidence since the 1978 law.

Barlow1: surveillance over current technical abilities. One of the reasons that wiretap hasn't been more abused is the bureaucratic overhead of current practices. Make it so that it doesn't require 50 agents to conduct a wire tap and you'll see a lot more of it. And Watergate included quite a number of wiretap violations. Indeed, the burglers were caught trying to install one. As to the assertion that we can always back up and destroy the databases if we don't like it, I can't imagine that someone as bright as yourself would believe that this is possible. Technology and power ratchet into positions which almost never retract without a complete change in the system of authority

RPTime: Care to respond Dr. Denning?

DDenning: Clipper would prevent the watergate burglars from getting anywhere since they wouldn't have a court order. Clipper will not make wiretaps cheaper or easier. Wiretaps are becoming more diffiults. And there will always be more agents involved becasue they have to follow exacting procedures, including minimization (throw out all conversations that are not specific to the crime at hand).

Barlow1: Dorothy, they were from the \*Government\* remember? I can't imagine that Nixon wouldn't have been able to find a sympathetic ear from somebody at NIST and somebody else at Treasury. Further, you're not talking about the truly insidious element of this, which is dramatically improved traffic analysis. Content is less important than context, and most agents will support this.

RPTime: Another question from the audience. JCMaille asks... Does the government have a constitutional right of access to my personal communications? Dr. Denning, why don't you go first?

DDenning: The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court order are Constitutional. At one time, communications were not even protected under the 4th Amendment. The government could wiretap without a court order! Now a court order is required.

PhilipED: To put the question another way, do citizens have a right to use powerful encryption?

DDenning: Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any encryption. Clipper is voluntary. You can still use something else.

RPTime: We have to apologize. John Barlow has temporarily lost his connection...

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, in your opinion... would a law outlawing powerful encryption be unconstitutional?

DDenning: I don't think so. But that doesn't mean it will happen.

RPTime: John Barlow is back with us. Sorry for the interruption! Barlow, Denning just said she didn't think a law banning powerful encryption would be unconstitutional What do you say? Hi folks. Don't know what happened. Gald to be back Gald indeed!

Barlow1: Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes are a violation of the 1st Amendment which specify speech without regard to the manner of speech. If we could restrict manner of speech, it would be constitutional to require that everyone speak English. Which of course it isn't

PhilipED: John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding citizens need powerful encryption?

Barlow1: Because it is in the nature of digitally networked communications to be quite visible. Everytime we make any sort of transaction in a digital environment, we smear our fingerprints all over Cyberspace. If we are to have any privacy in the future, we will need virtual "walls" made of cryptography.

RPTime: Another audience question... Isn't this like the gun argument? If guns are outlawed only criminals will have guns? Well, if clipper is standardized, won't criminals be the ones NOT using it?

RPTime: Dr. Denning? If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it will be the chief method of encryption. That would be what you'd get at Radio Shack. What criminals use will depend on what is readily available and what their cohorts are using. Both parties of a conversation have to use the same thing. Criminals also talk to a lot of people outside their immediate circle - e.g., to buy goods and services. Also, they can be quite stupid at times. But the main thing is that criminals will not be able to take advantage of the SKIPJACK algorithm as a way of concealing their conversations. This is the whole point. It is not to catch criminals. It is to allow people access to a really high quality algorithm in a way that someone cannot use it to conceal criminal activity.

Barlow1: The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't for the life of me imagine why we would think that even a stupid criminal would use Clipper if something else were available. And when I talk to people in the administration their big hobgoblin is the "nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any fanatic smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear device is going to be smart enough to download PGP from a bulletin board somewhere. Also, I'd like to point out that the gun analogy doesn't go the whole distance. Crypto is by its nature a purely \*defensive\* technology. You can't shoot people with it.

PhilipED: Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption system secure, in your opinion?

DDenning: I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the IDEA algorithm that it uses.

RPTime: Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW.. This is for Dr. Denning. What is the evidence of harm if the Clipper proposal is not adopted?

DDenning: The harm would be to the government. They would not be able to use it and would have to resort to something less secure. Also, Clipper is part of a larger project to make hardware available for encryption and digital signatures. This will be used, for example, in the Defense Message System. The goverment needs a new standard. I personally believe that making really powerful encryption like SKIPJACK available without key escrow could be harmful to society. Wiretaps have been essential for preventing and solving many serious crimes and terrorist activities.

Barlow1: Why on earth would the government have to use something else if they failed to get the rest of rest of us to buy into this folly? Hey, they are already using SKIPJACK. It's a government algorithm and has been in use for a...

DDenning: CPSR and others are asking the government to drop Clipper.

Barlow1: long time. There are plenty other algorithms which we can use which are truly protected... unless of course, this is only the first step in a process which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I believe that it must be. Makes absolutely no sense otherwise. EFF is not asking the Government to drop Clipper, though we would vastly prefer they did. We're merely asking that no steps be taken to require it either by law or practice...as, for example, would be the case if you had to use a Clipper chip to file your tax return.

PhilipED: Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in a process to outlaw crypto"?

DDenning: No I do not. The government has not been using SKIPJACK to my knowledge. The Clipper initiative represents the first time that the government has put one of their really good algorithms out there in the unclassified arena. They are trying to do this in a way that won't backfire against the public. Other NSA developed algorithms are not available for purchase by the public.

Barlow1: I appreciate their willingness to make some of that crypto research available to a public which has paid so much for it, but I'm afraid that I would never trust an algorithm which was given to me by any government. And I certainly don't trust a classified algorithm like Skipjack, even without a back door which everyone can see. I think I'll stick to systems which have been properly vetted to be clear of such compromises, like RSA. I hope others will do likewise and that RSA will become the standard which Clipper shouldn't be.

RPTime: Time for one more question from our audience... To John Barlow. Isn't society becoming increasingly vulnerable to concerted criminal/terrorist disruption, requiring \*stronger\* law enforcement tools?

Barlow1: Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm willing to take my chances with the few terrorists and drug lords there are out there rather than trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited surveillance power which Clipper and Digital Telephony would give them. It's a touch choice. But when you look at the evil perpetrated by government over this century in the name of stopping crime, it far exceeds that done by other organized criminals.

RPTime: Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology enhanced police abilities to eavesdrop to the point... where the loss of a few wire taps won't mean much?

DDenning: No. They need to get the cooperation of the service providers to implement a wiretap. The loss of some wiretaps could be costly indeed. As an example, wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved plans by a Chicago gang from shooting down a commercial airliner. There have been 2 cases where they helped save the lives of kids who were going to be kidnaped for the making of a snuff murder film. They helped solve a case where a man's house was going to be bombed. I could go on. If we take John's arguments about law enforcement to their logical conclusion, we'd just get rid of law enforcement. I think it's better to have it. The people in law enforcement hate it as much as the rest of us when some member of the community does something wrong. And they correct it, design new procedures and laws where necessary, and go on.

Barlow1: Oh, please. I'm not proposing eliminating police. I'm opposing giving them unlimited powers. Also,these are the same cases cited over and over by everyone from you to Judge Freeh. Surely, we aren't going to fundamentally change the balance of power in this country because of these two (undocumented, to my knowledge) stories.

DDenning: Clipper is not going to change the balance of power. It does not give law enforcement any additional authority to do wiretaps.

Barlow1: Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy. If we could continue the same level of LE capacity we presently have, I'd have no objection. But I believe, for reasons I'm not sure we have the bandwidth to discuss here, that we are talking about dramatically enhancing their abilities. For one thing, we would greatly reduce the bureaucratic overhead involved in wiretap, which is what keeps it under 900 cases nationwide at the present.

RPTime: And that will have to be the last word on the matter for tonight...

DDenning: The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase, not decrease.

PhilipED: Not quite! Maybe not! ;-)

RPTime: THAT will be the final word!

Barlow1: Well, let's get together and talk, Dorothy.

RPTime: TIME thanks Dr. Dorothy Denning and John Perry Barlow for being with us tonight... along with Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Thank you all, and goodnight! Thank you both. This was very interesting.

DDenning: Thank you for the opportunity to be here!





Being in Nothingness
====================

Virtual Reality and the Pioneers of Cyberspace

"Cyberspace.  A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation...A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity.  Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data.  Like city lights, receding..."

--William Gibson, Neuromancer

Suddenly I don't have a body anymore.

All that remains of the aging shambles which usually constitutes my corporeal self  is a glowing, golden hand floating before me like Macbeth's dagger.  I point my finger and drift down its length to the bookshelf on the office wall.

I try to grab a book but my hand passes through it.

"Make a fist inside the book and you'll have it," says my invisible guide.

I do, and when I move my hand again, the book remains embedded in it.  I open my hand and withdraw it.  The book remains suspended above the shelf.

I look up.  Above me I can see the framework of red girders which supports the walls of the office...above them the blue-blackness of space.  The office has no ceiling, but it hardly needs one.  There's never any weather here.

I point up and begin my ascent, passing right through one of the overhead beams on my way up.  Several hundred feet above the office, I look down. It sits in the middle of a little island in space.   I remember the home asteroid of The Little Prince with its one volcano, it's one plant.

How very like the future this place might be: a tiny world just big enough to support the cubicle of one Knowledge Worker.  I feel a wave of loneliness and head back down.  But I'm going too fast.  I plunge right on through the office floor and into the bottomless indigo below.  Suddenly I can't remember how to stop and turn around.  Do I point behind myself?  Do I have to turn around before I can point?  I flip into brain fugue. "Just relax," says my guide in her cool clinical voice.  "Point straight up and open your hand when you get where you want to be."

Sure.  But how can you get where you want to be when you're coming from nowhere at all?

And I don't seem to have a location exactly.  In this pulsating new landscape, I've been reduced to a point of view.  The whole subject of "me" yawns into a chasm of interesting questions.  It's like Disneyland for epistomologists.  "If a virtual tree falls in the computer-generated forest..?"  Or "How many cybernauts can dance on the head of a shaded solid?"  Gregory Bateson would have loved this.  Wittgenstein, phone home.

At least I know where I left my body.  It's in a room called Cyberia in a building called Autodesk in a town called Sausalito, California.  Planet Earth.  Milky Way.  So on and so forth.  My body is cradled in its usual cozy node of space-time vectors.

But I...or "I"...am in cyberspace, a universe churned up from computer code by a Compaq 386 and a pair of Matrox graphics boards, then fed into my rods and cones by  VPL Eyephones, a set of goggles through whose twin, parallax-corrected video screens I see this new world.

When I move my head, the motion is tracked by a a Polhemus magnetic sensor and the imaging engine of cyberspace is instructed to alter what I see accordingly.  Thus, having made a controlled ascent back up through the floor of the "office," I turn to the left and I see red chair with a desk behind it.  I turn to the right and I see a door leading out onto the floating platform.

The configuration and position of my right hand is fed into the system by a VPL DataGlove, also with an Polhemus attached to it.  The relationship between my hand and the eyephones is precisely measured by the two trackers so that my hand appears where I would expect it to.  When I point or make a fist, the fiber optics sewn into the DataGlove convert kinesthetics into electronics.  For a decisecond or so, my hand disappears and then reappears, glowing and toon-like, in the appropriate shape.

Despite the current confines of my little office-island, I know that I have become a traveller in a realm which will be ultimately bounded only by human imagination, a world without any of the usual limits of geography, growth, carrying capacity, density or ownership.  In this magic theater, there's no gravity, no Second Law of Thermodynamics, indeed, no laws at all beyond those imposed by computer processing speed...and given the accelerating capacity of that constraint, this universe will probably expand faster than the one I'm used to.

Welcome to Virtual Reality.  We've leapt through the looking glass.  Now what?  Go ask Alice.

The Next Big Thing

Money from Nuthin'

"I think this is the biggest thing since we landed on the Moon," says Jaron Lanier, the dread-locked CEO of VPL Research.  (Who was 9 years old at that time.)  I don't choke on that one.  Indeed, I'd take it a bit farther, guessing that Columbus was probably the last person to behold so much usable and unclaimed real estate (or unreal estate) as these cybernauts have discovered.

At Autodesk, the Sausalito publisher of AutoCAD drafting software, they spent the summer of '89 in product development heaven, talking telephone, automobile, airplane, computer.  They invoked Edison, Bell, Ford, and Jobs. And there was that loincloth-and-machete sense of enterprise which one might have experienced in the Wright Brothers' Akron Bicycle Shop or Paul Jobs' garage in Mountain View...as well as countless less-chronicled shots at perpetual motion or baldness cures.

Neil Armstrong's small step ran about 70 Billion Real Dollars, but when John Walker, the Hacker King of Autodesk, committed his company to creating the first commercially-available "world in a can," he figured that the prototype "gizmo" could be built for about $25,000.

VPL, the other trading post on VR frontier, isn't much fatter, although internal synergy seems to magnify output.  Since their incorporation in 1985, they've had two Scientific American covers and produced the DataGlove, DataSuit, the PowerGlove, Swivel 3-D and VPL EyePhones, the only commercially available head-mounted display.  They've been in a couple of big lawsuits (one, just concluded to their satisfaction, with Stanford University), and create, at a distance, the mirage of a fair-sized company going at it pretty hard.

But up close, one can get on a first-name basis with every VPL employee in the course of an afternoon. They have yet to outgrow the third floor of their slightly tacky building at the Redwood City yacht harbor.

While Apple's research gazillions yield such dubious fruit as multimedia and the AppleFax Modem, while IBM replicates methods for chaining bureaucrats to its mainframes,  it begins to appear that the Next Big Thing will begin its commercial evolution as humbly as the personal computer.

As usual, the Big Guys have neither the means nor the desire to engage in such open-ended creation as settling the virtual universe will require. Like the Union Pacific Railroad awaiting the fact of empire, they prefer to let the rag-tag pioneers die all over the frontier before they come out to claim it.

When the Altairs and Osbornes of Virtual Reality have made their fatal errors are headed for Chapter 11, IBM probably will issue forth the SolutionStation VR Network or some such and accelerate natural selection in the field.

But as I write this, VPL and Autodesk still have  it to themselves.

Actually, they are not the first to make virtual landfall. They are only the first at financial risk. Unlike the first automobiles or telephones their commercial fledglings had the advantage of long incubation by government and Academia.

Virtual Reality, as a concept, found first form at the University of Utah over twenty years ago in the fecund cranium of Ivan E. Sutherland, the godfather of computer graphics and the originator of about every  Big Computer Idea not originated by Alan Kay or Doug Englebart.  In 1968, he produced the first head-mounted display.  This was the critical element in VR hardware, but it was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling...atsome peril to its wearer.  Damocles was mentioned.

Besides, once you got it on, there wasn't much to see in there.  There wasn't a computer in existence which could churn out enough polygons per second to simulate a reality much more full-bodied than a game of Pong.

So Virtual Reality passed a generation waiting for the equipment to arrive. In 1985 the Japanese finally (and unintentionally) provided us with the right video displays when NASA's Mike McGreevy happened to notice that the Citizen Watch Co. LCD displays in a Radio Shack mini-TV were small enough to fit two in a head-mounted.

I hardly need to detail what happened to CPU horsepower during that period. By 1985, graphics engines of appropriate juice were almost within financial range of entities not involved in the defense of our nation.

Also by this time, NASA had made a strong commitment to VR research, though mostly in the service of "telepresence," the ability to project one's judgement and actions into a robot located some real place you'd rather not be, like space.  They were less persuaded by the attractions of unreal places.

The Air Force was also conducting research at Wright-Patterson under the direction of Tom Furness, but most of this was directed at the usual dismal purpose, simplifying the annihilation of non-virtual humans.  Heads up displays and looks that kill were their speciality.

For all this expenditure of tax dollars, Virtual Reality still lacked two critical elements: a sense of whimsy and a fluid, three-dimensional method for "grabbing" and manipulating the furniture of cyberspace.  VPL was on the case.

VPL's Tom Zimmerman had always wanted the ability to actually play air guitar.  It was the sort of desire his "boss," Jaron Lanier, could understand. Jaron had only gotten into computers after concluding that musical composition was not a reliable day job.  And his ownership of more than 300 musical instruments might indicate, if nothing else, a probing dissatisfaction with the limits of each one.

Over a two year period, Zimmerman and Young Harvill (also of VPL) created the DataGlove, a hand with which to strum those invisible strings.  While they were creating this hardware interface (though the Spandex feel of the DataGlove makes "leisureware interface" seem like a more appropriate term), Jaron and Chuck Blanchard were writing Body Electric, the software necessary to map the actual movements of the DataGlove and eyephones onto the virtual landscape.

The commercial colonization of cyberspace was beginning.  VPL's strategy was to build the most powerful simulations current technology would allow, without regard to hardware cost, selling the spin-offs at increasingly affordable prices.  Once such item, the PowerGlove, is a Nintendo game controller based on the DataGlove which VPL has licensed to Mattel. (Available this Christmas at a store near you for $85.00.)

Another VPL spin-off product is Swivel 3-D, odds on the best 3-D modeler for the Macintosh.  Young Harvill wrote it as a tool to create an artificial reality quickly and easily on Mac before integrating it into Body Electric and sending it over the twin Silicon Graphics CPUs which blow it up to full size.

In September of 1988, John Walker wrote an internal Autodesk white paper called Through the Looking Glass: Beyond "User Interfaces."   In it he proposed an "Autodesk Cyberpunk Initiative" to produce within 16 months a doorway into cyberspace...available to anyone with $15,000 and a 386 computer.  The project's motto:  "Reality Isn't Enough Any More."  (I wondered if they considered: "I'd rather have a computer in front of me than a frontal lobotomy...")

Since NASA's Virtual Realities were running in the millions and VPL's in the middle hundreds of thousands, Walker envisioned a significant discount over previous models, but he knew that his customers, if any, would be more bargain-conscious than, say, the U.S. Air Force.

Autodesk's Cyberia Project was running hard by Christmas, 1988, staffed by William and Meredith Bricken, Eric Gullichsen, Pat Gelband, Eric Lyons, Gary Wells, Randy Walser, and John Lynch.  When I arrived on the scene in May, they had been keeping hacker's hours for a long time.

And they were ready to make a product.  They'd made a promo video starring Timothy Leary.  Gullichsen had even registered William Gibson's term "cyberspace"  as an Autodesk trademark, prompting an irritated Gibson to apply for trademark registration of the term "Eric Gullichsen."  By June, they had an implementation which, though clearly the Kitty Hawk version of the technology, endowed people with an instantaneous vision of the Concorde level.

Meanwhile, back in the real world, things were getting complicated.  While everyone who went to Autodesk's Cyberia agreed that Virtual Reality was something, there was less agreement as to what.

Part of the problem was the scale of possibilities it invoked.  They seemed to be endless and yet none of them was anywhere near ready to return an investment.  But when something has endless possibilities, each of them is liable to dilute down to a point where people start to say things like, "Sure, but what's it really good for."  At which point the devoted cybernut might lapse into random syllables, his tongue heavy with all that golden potential.

Virtual Reality induces a perception of huge potency underlying featureless ambiguity.  There is a natural tendency to fill this gap between power and definition with ideology.  And the presence of such unclaimed vastness seems to elicit territorial impulses from psychic regions too old to recognize the true infinity of this new frontier.  Disputes appeared like toadstools in the rich new soil of cyberspace.

Thus, by mid-November, the Autodesk half of the Next Big Thing was down to one full-time hacker: Randy Walser.  The Brickens had headed to Seattle to join Tom Furness in a (non-lethal) VR research program at the University of Washington.  Eric Gullichsen and Pat Gelband had formed their own VR company, Sense 8.  (Get it?)

Within, VPL's soulful band remained as tightly bonded as a Hell's Angels chapter.  Without, they found themselves increasingly tangled in legal hassles.  They were in court with AGE (a group of New York toy developers who are not just in it for their health), trying to protect their rights to the PowerGlove.  They'd just settled a suit with Stanford University.  In general, they were having experiences which made me question the axiom that you can't cheat an honest man.

Still, everyone realized that a baby this size would be bound to occasion some labor pains.  As the general media began to pick up on Virtual Reality, its midwives were preparing themselves for interesting times.  It would be worth it.  But why?

To the people who will actually make the future, such a question is beside the point.  They will develop cyberspace because, like Mallory's mountain, it's there.  Sort of.

There some practical reasons for the settlement of cyberspace.  They aren't as much fun to think about as the impractical ones, but they exist.  First among them is that this is the next logical step in the quest to eliminate the interface...the mind-machine information barrier.

Over the last twenty years, our relations with these magic boxes have become intimate at a rate matched only by the accelerating speed of their processors.  From the brutal austerity of batch-processed punch-cards to the snuggly Macintosh, the interface has become far less cryptic and far more interactive.

There have remained some apparently unbreachable barriers between us and the CPU.  One of them was the keyboard, which even with the graphical interface and the accompanying infestation of mice, remained the principal thoroughfare from human perception to RAM.  The thin alphanumeric stream which drips from our fingertips and into the computer is a pale reflection of the thoughts which produce it, arriving before the CPU at a pace absurdly mis-matched to its chewing/spitting capacities.

Then there is the screen itself.  While a vast improvement on the flickering LED's of the Altair or even the amber text of DOS, the metaphorical desktop remains flat as paper.  There is none of the depth or actual spatiality of experience.

After we get past what few documents we can keep on the screen at one time, we are back to the alphabetized hierarchy.  We can't pile it, as most of us tend to do in real life.  We have to file it.  And this is not the way the mind stores information.  One doesn't remember the names of his friends alphabetically.  When looking for a phase in a book, you are more likely to look for its spatial position on the page than it's intellectual position in context.

The actual operation of human memory works on a model more like the one Saint Thomas Aquinas used.  Aquinas, who carried around in his head almost all the established knowledge of his simpler world, is said to have imagined a mind-castle with many different rooms in which varying kinds of ideas dwelled.  The floor plan increased with his knowledge.

Nicholas Negroponte recreated a modest version of Aquinas' castle in the 70's.  He came up with a virtual office, represented in cartoon form on the screen.  One could mouse around to the "piles" of  "paper" stacked on the "desk" or "filing cabinet," leafing through them not by the first letter of their subject name but by their archaeological layer of deposition.

The problem was the screen.  Negroponte created a flat picture of an office rather than something more like the real thing because that was all one could display on a screen.  In two dimensions, the image of desktop seemed a lot more natural than the image of the desk.  Thence the Macintosh.

I used to think that the only way around these narrow I/O apertures lay in such heroic solutions as brain implants.  I think I was about 14 when it occurred to me that this was the answer.  Brain surgery seemed a minor nuisance if it left one with the ability to remember everything.

I suppose I'd still be willing to put a Cray in my cranium, but my faith in technology has moderated since early adolescence.  I'm more comfortable with the possibility of an interface which fills the gap between keyboarding and neurological hardwiring and involves no cortical knife-play.  Virtual Reality is almost certainly that.

And indeed, Virtual Reality may be so close to the implant side of the continuum that, as Randy Walser of Autodesk insists, it's not even appropriate to call it an interface.  It more a place...kind of like Fibber McGee's Ultimate Closet...than the semi-permeable information membrane to which we're accustomed.

Whatever you want to call it, Autodesk's John Walker puts it this way, "If cyberspace truly represents the next generation of human interaction with computers, it will represent the most profound change since the development of the personal computer."  Right.

But that still doesn't tell us what it's good for besides extending human quirkiness to the storage of immaterial stuff.  After all, most of what humans do with computers is merely an improvement over what they did with other keyboard-bound devices, whether typewriters or calculators.  Word processing and numerical analysis will be no easier "inside" the machine than it was outside.

But let's quit being giddy for a moment.  We're talking bucks here.  Right now a good working platform costs almost as much as a CAT scanner.  Who's going to buy one without something like Blue Cross footing the bill?  And why?

Alright, there is a reason why Autodesk is involved in this enterprise besides some daydream of the Ultimate Hack.  Whatever adventures they might entertain they afford by selling AutoCAD, the Dbase III of architecture. How many architects have dreamed of the ability to take their clients on a walk inside their drawings before their miscommunications were sealed in mortar?

Virtual Reality has already been put to such use at the University of North Carolina.  There Sitterman Hall, the new $10 million home of UNC's computer science department, was designed by virtual means.

Using a head-mounted display along with a handlebar-steerable treadmill, the building's future users "walked through" it, discovering, among other things, a discomforting misplacement of a major interior wall in the lobby. At the point of the discovery, moving the wall out was cheap.  A retrofit following the first "real" walk-through would have cost more by several orders of magnitude.  Thus, one can imagine retrofit savings from other such examples which could start to make DataSuits as common a form of architectural apparel as chinos and tweed.

Given the fact that AutoCAD is already generating about  a hundred seventy million dollars a year even without such pricy appurtenances as cyberspace design tools, it isn't hard to imagine a scenario in which developing workstations for virtual architecture comes to look like very shrewd business.

Then there is the burgeoning scientific market.  Computers are the new microscopes.  Increasingly, they allow us to see into worlds which are not only too small but too weird to bring to human scale before.   For example, they are showing us the infinitely detailed order of chaos, never before observable, in a form which makes it possible to appreciate its simplicity as well as its complexity.

Virtual Reality promises the ability to not only see but to "touch"forbidden realms.  Again at UNC, work is already quite advanced in which one can assemble complex molecules like Tinkertoys, the attraction or repulsion between individual atoms in the assembly modelled to the scale of human tactile perceptions.  The drug industry alone could have uses for such capacity sufficient to sustain a lot of CyberBiz.

One can imagine a lot of heretofore inaccessible "places" in which one's presence might be scientifically illuminating.  A Fantastic Voyage through the circulatory system will become possible (with or without Raquel Welch). Or travel to alien worlds.  (Thanks to JPL, I have already taken an extremely convincing helicopter ride down the Vallis Marinaris on Mars.)

Then there all the places which have never before had physical existence on any scale: the rolling plains of mathematical topologies, the humming lattice of quantum states, cloud chambers in which mu mesons are the size of basketballs and decay over weeks rather than picoseconds.

The possibility for less sober uses seems equally fertile.  One can imagine VR salons, video game parlors for big kids with Gold Cards, in which a central supercomputer provides the opportunity for a score of people to be Ms. Pacman.  Or whatever.  Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari and something of an expert on the subject of video games, is already at work on something like this.

The list of possibilities is literally bounded only by the imagination. Working bodies for the damaged.  Teleconferencing with body language. Virtual surgery.  Hey, this is a practical thing to do!

And yet I suspect that something else altogether, something not so practical,  is at the root of these yearnings.  Why do we really want to develop Virtual Reality?  There seems to be a flavor of longing here which I associate with the desire to converse with aliens or dolphins or the never-born.

On some level, I think we can now see the potential for technology, long about the business of making the metaphorical literal, of reversing the process and re-infecting ordinary reality with luminous magic.

Or maybe this is just another expression of what may be the third oldest human urge, the desire of have visions.  Maybe we want to get high.

Drugs, Sex, & Rock 'n' Roll

Boot Up, Jack In, Get Virtual

Technology is the new drugs.

--Jerry Garcia

Knowing that Garcia is a sucker for anything which might make a person question all he knows, I gave him a call not long after my first cyberspace demo.  Hell yes, he was interested.  When?  If I'd told him 6:00 AM, I think he'd have been there on time.

He adapted to it quicker than anyone I'd watched other than my 4 year old daughter Anna (who came home and told her sisters matter-of-factly that she been to a neat "place" that afternoon.)

By the time he crossed back over to our side of Reality Horizon, he was pretty kid-like himself.  "Well," he finally said, "they outlawed LSD. It'll be interesting to see what they do with this."

Which brings me to a point which makes Jaron Lanier very uncomfortable. The closest analog to Virtual Reality in my experience is psychedelic, and, in fact, cyberspace is already crawling with delighted acid heads.

The reason Jaron resents the comparison is that it is both inflammatory (now that all drugs are evil) and misleading.  The Cyberdelic Experience isn't like tripping, but it is as challenging to describe to the uninitiated and it does force some of the same questions, most of them having to do with the fixity of reality itself.

While you can hardly expect people to lay down $15,000 for something just because it shakes their basic tenets, that's enough to make it worth the trip for me.  I think the effort to create convincing artificial realities will teach us the same humbling lesson about reality which artificial intelligence has taught us about intelligence...namely, that we don't know a damned thing about it.

I've never been of the cut-and-dried school on your Reality Question.  I have a feeling VR will further expose the conceit that "reality" is a fact. It will provide another reminder of the seamless continuity between the world outside and the world within delivering another major hit to the old fraud of objectivity.  "'Real'," as Kevin Kelly put it, "is going to be one of the most relative words we'll have."

And that's just fine with me, since so much of what's wrong in America is based on the pathological need for certainty and the idiotic delusion that such a condition can even exist.

Another reason for relating this to acid is the overwhelming sense of its cultural scale.  It carries with it a cosmic titillation I haven't experienced since 1966.  There is also the same dense shower of synchronicities surrounding it.  (I must have run into William and Meredith Bricken ten times, always unexpectedly and sometimes in the strangest of places.  Today, as I was typing his name, Jaron called me for the first time in three weeks.  Then I felt strangely moved to call Eric Gullichson after a couple of months of silence.  He told me that yesterday had been his last day at Autodesk.  Etc. Etc. Etc.)

Finally, Timothy Leary is all excited again.  Now I don't endow every one of his pronouncements with oracular qualities...I remember the Comet Starseed... but I have always thought that Uncle Tim is kind of like a reverse of the canary in the coal mine.  Whenever the culture is about to make a big move, he's the first canary to start jumping up and down.

He's also, like Zelig, a kind of Zeitgeist chameleon.  He spent the 40's in the Army.  In the 50's, he was a tweedy young college professor, a Jules Feiffer cartoon.  In the 60's, he was, well, Timothy Leary.  In the 70's, he became, along with H. R. Haldeman, a political prisoner.  He lived up the material 80's in Beverly Hills.  Whatever America is about to do, Tim starts doing it first.

When I visited him recently, he was already as cyberpunk as he had been psychedelic when I last saw at Millbrook 22 years ago.  Still, his current persona seems reasonable, even seraphic.  He calmly scored a long list of persuasive points, the most resonant of which is that most Americans have been living in Virtual Reality since the proliferation of television.  All cyberspace will do is make the experience interactive instead of passive.

"Our brains are learning how to exhale as well as inhale in the data-sphere." he said.  Like our finny ancestors crawling up on land, we are about to be come amphibians again, equally at home in visceral and virtual frames.

The latest bus is pulling out of the station.  As usual, Leary has been on it for a while, waiting patiently for it to depart.

Then there is the...uhhhm...sexual thing.  I have been through eight or ten Q. & A. sessions on Virtual Reality and I don't remember one where sex didn't come up.  As though the best thing about all this will be the infinite abundance of shaded polygonal party dolls.  As though we are devising here some fabulously expensive form of Accu-jac.

This is strange.  I don't what to make of it, since, as things stand right now, nothing could be more disembodied or insensate than the experience of cyberspace.  It's like having had your everything amputated.  You're left mighty under-endowed and any partner would be so insubstantial you could walk right through her without either of you feeling a thing.  (In fact, when people play tag in Jaron's Reality Built for Two, one strategy is to hide inside the other person's head.)

And I did overhear the word "DataCondom" at one point...  Maybe the nerds who always ask this question will get a chance to make it with their computers at long last.  (I prefer not to think too much of how anyone who would want to make it with a machine might treat the women in their lives...if any there be.)

Fortunately, I think these dreams of cybersex will be thwarted by their own realization.  Yes, it will work for that purpose and it will be easy.  But the real point of Virtual Reality, as with life itself, is contact. Contact with oneself alone is certainly a laudable enough goal, but the presence of half a million dollars worth of equipment between that subject and object is neither necessary nor desirable.

Even if Virtual Reality turns out to provide the format for the ultimate pornographic film...a "feelie" with a perfect body...it will serve us better as the ultimate telephone.

Life in the DataCloud

Scratching Your Eyes Back In

There was a man who lived in town

And he was wondrous wise.

He jumped into a bramble bush

And scratched out both his eyes.

And when he saw what he had done,

With all his might and main,

He jumped back in the bramble bush

And scratched them in again.

                -Old English Nursery Rhyme

Information is alienated experience.

                -Jaron Lanier

Since the Sumerians starting poking sticks into clay and claiming that the resulting cuneiform squiggles meant something, we've been living in the Information Age.  Only lately did someone come up with a name for it.  I suppose that was because we quit making anything else of value.  Before that, they just called it civilization.

Indeed, one could make a pretty good case that consciousness, as we define it, arose simultaneously with the ability to communicate its products symbolically.  (See The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Brain by Julian Jaynes for related conclusions.)

The Sumerians had a pretty clear perspective on what this stuff was good for.  The preponderance of their runic tablets turn out to be, on translation, calendars, inventories, and mnemonic devices for such data as one might need to remember but which was too trivial to merit conversion into the other storage form of the era, epic poetry.  They didn't use it to describe anything.

Perhaps they recognized that even the most mundane experience would beggar any effort to describe it if one were serious about creating a genuine simulation.

The Egyptians didn't have any such illusions either, but, in addition to keeping track of cubits and high water, they found symbols useful for their elaborate liturgical purposes.  With so many dramatis personae in the pantheon, some method was required for sorting out each one's ritualistic preferences.

The Greeks, as was their wont, expanded the envelope further.  To the previously established (and sensible) uses for writing, they added commentary, philosophy, calculation and drama.

Still, they restrained themselves from attempting to simulate experience on paper (or whatever it was they wrote on).  One might argue that drama was an effort to do that, but I think that the likes of Sophocles probably just found it easier not to have to personally teach his actors all their lines.

As early as the 5th Century B.C. we hear the first warnings that information might constitute an abuse of experience.  Socrates suggested that writing things down might damage your ability to remember them in their proper, full-bodied form.  (An admonition we know about since Plato went ahead and wrote it down as soon as Socrates was hemlocked out of the ability to stop him.)

It wasn't until the 17th Century that things really got out of hand. Cervantes wrote Don Quixote and fiction was born.  From that point, any experience could be plucked from its holy moment in time and pressed like a flower in a book, to be reconstituted later in the imagination of the reader.

The thin, alphanumeric trickle that is language was suddenly thought to be a acceptable surrogate for the boiling torrent of shapes, smells, colors, sounds, memories, and context which amalgamate in the cauldron of a human skull and become there something called Reality.  No longer did one have to "be there."  One could read about it and get the flavor well enough.

This absurd delusion is now universal.  The only reason anyone believes it is that everyone does.

I, on the other hand, began to have my doubts around the time I started trying to create some of this magical information myself.  Sometime in the 4th Grade, I began to write about the things that happened to me.  For awhile, the approval others showed my efforts was enough to inspire their continuation.

Gradually, however, the effort became painful.  The inadequacy of my word-replicas for experience was increasingly clear.  I tried poetry.  This seemed to work until I realized that it did so because a poem is about itself and thus has no "real thing" to be compared to.

Writing about something continues to cause me nothing but anguish.  The symbolic tools are hopelessly mis-matched to their three-dimensional analogues.  For example, the word "chair" is in no way like any chair.

Nor does it begin to imply the vast range of dissimilar objects to which one might apply it.  You can hop it up with adjectives... "big red chair"...or additional phrases... "big red chair that Washington sat in"...but the result is usually bad writing without much advancement of your cause.  I mean, "the big, deeply red, densely-brocaded, Georgian love seat that Washington sat in while being bled by leeches" is still, for all its lugubrious mass, not a chair.

And if it were, it wouldn't move in the way that real things do even when they're standing still.  Words just sit there.  Reality vibrates and hums. I have a pet phrase for this element of the mismatch:  Using words to describe an experience is like using bricks to build a full-sized, operational model of a fog bank.

Perhaps it was a subliminal recognition of this fact that caused America to fall in love with statistics.  As a descriptive tool, numbers are even worse than words.  They are very purely themselves and nothing else. Nevertheless, we now put everything from flowing water to the human psyche into these rigid numerical boxes and are especially straight-faced as we claim it fits in them.

In doing this, we usually follow a rule I call, with characteristic modesty, Barlow's Law of Real Numbers.  This states that the combination of any two speculative numbers by any arithmetic operation will always yield a real number.  The more decimal places the better.

Computers have hardly been part of the solution in this area.  We pass our measuring grids over pulsating reality, shovel the results into our machines, thrash them with micro-circuits, and pretend that what floats up to the screen is "real."

Horseshit.

What computers can do, and have done to a fare-thee-well, is to provide us with a hyper-abundance of such processed lies.  Everything from U.S. News and World Report to Penthouse is now a dense thicket of charts, tables, graphs, and %'s.  All purporting to tell us something about what is.

But it's all just information.  Which, apart from the fact that it's not to be confused with experience,  has several problems which Jaron Lanier succinctly enumerated for me: "The first problem is that it's information. The second problem is that it's linear information.  And the third problem is that it's false information."

Or, as we say in Wyoming, "Figures don't lie, but liars can figure."

Virtual Reality is probably not going to cure this nonsense any more than television, its one-way predecessor, has done.  The global supply of words, numbers, statistics, projections, analyses, and gossip...what I call the DataCloud... expands with thermonuclear vigor and all the Virtual Reality we can manufacture isn't going to stop that.

But it may go a long way toward giving us means to communicate which are based on shared experience rather than what we can squeeze through this semi-permeable alphanumeric membrane.  If it won't contain the DataCloud, it might at least provide some navigational aids through it.

Maybe it can scratch our eyes, blinded by information, back in again.

Coming Into the Country

For the January, 1991

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no other side. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate which expands with development.

Imagine a place were trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen an infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where businesses you never heard of can own the history of your personal affairs, where only children feel fully at home, where the physics is psychology, and where everyone is as virtual as the shadows in Plato's cave.

Such a place actually exists, if "place" is the right word for it. It consists of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our electronic processing and communication systems. I used to call it the Datasphere until I read William Gibson's Neuromancer and discovered that he had already given it the perfectly evocative name of Cyberspace.

Of course Gibson thought he was conjuring up some manifestation of a fanciful future. In fact, Cyberspace has been around, with rapidly increasing range and density, since that moment in March of 1876 when a certain Mr. Watson encountered Alexander Graham Bell there.

It is still familiar to most people as the "location" of a long-distance telephone conversation. But it is also the repository for all digital or electronically transferred information, and, as such, it is the venue for most of what is now commerce, industry, and broad-scale human interaction. Indeed, if you have any money besides what's crumpled in your pocket, it's probably in Cyberspace.

Few have even noticed this arising domain, despite the fact that most of us use its resources daily. Every day millions of people use ATM's and credit cards, place telephone calls, make travel reservations, and access information of limitless variety without any clear perception of the digital machinations behind these transactions.

Our financial, legal, and even physical lives are increasingly dependent on realities of which we have only dimmest awareness. We have entrusted the basic functions of modern existence to institutions we cannot name, using tools we've never heard of and could not operate if we had.

Thus, for all its importance to modern existence, Cyberspace remains a frontier region, across which roam the few aboriginal technologists and cyberpunks who can tolerate the austerity of its savage computer interfaces, incompatible communications protocols, proprietary barricades, cultural and legal ambiguities, and general lack of useful maps or metaphors.

Certainly, the old concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context, based as they are on physical manifestation, do not apply succinctly in a world where there can be none.

Sovereignty over this new world is not well defined. Large institutions own much of the hardware which supports it and therefore claim, with some justification, to hegemony over the whole thing.

Some of the locals... the UNIX cultists, sysops, netheads and byte drovers... are like the mountain men of the Fur Trade. They may be somewhat uncivilized, but most of them have come here in the service of corporations. However grudgingly, they tend to accept the idea that institutions can own information.

Another group, the cyberpunks, are nomadic and tribal. They have an Indian sense of property and are about as agreeable to the notion of proprietary data as the Shoshones were to the idea that the Union Pacific owned the landscape of southern Wyoming. By asserting their freedom of both movement and access to the local resource... knowledge... they have developed a culture in which the violation of institutional boundaries is inevitable. This will lead to more adamant efforts at security. And they will be met with an ascending symmetry of cracker ingenuity until either security is perfect (at which time no system will be accessible) or the savages take on civilization.

As communications and data processing technology continues to advance at a pace many times faster than society can assimilate it, additional conflicts have begun to occur on the border between Cyberspace and the physical world. Among the non-nerdly a kind of neo-Luddism is arising at the prospect of being dragged by Brute Progress into a place where they can't even take their bodies.

Every day it dawns on more ordinary corporate employees that they have become "knowledge workers." They find themselves chained to a device which is maddeningly uncooperative and inflexible in its mysterious requirements, and with which they perform tasks of questionable necessity. Worse, each time they master one opaque interface, their MIS master imposes on them version 2.0 and they have to start all over again. They are stuck on the Learning Curve of Sisyphus. They are not happy there.

And whether he works in an office or not, nearly everyone now has the nagging suspicion that, somewhere out there are hard disks containing information about his personal affairs which is either inaccurate or which he would prefer than no one knew. Worse, he knows that there is little he can do to alter this condition.

As a consequence, increasing numbers are coming to hate and fear not only the technology itself but the people who create it. In a very short time, the term "hacker" has gone from being an honorable appellation implying computer wizardry to a malign epithet of digital nihilism. There is a reason for this.

But Cyberspace is the homeland of the Information Age, the place where the citizens of the future are destined to dwell. We will all go there whether we want to or not and we would do better to approach the place with a settler's determination to civilize it as rapidly as possible.

What would it mean to civilize Cyberspace? To some, the answer to this question is simple and historically familiar: exterminate the savages, secure the resources into corporate possession, establish tariffs, and define culture strictly in terms of economy.

Such an approach, while highly advantageous to large institutions, might have serious consequences for the individuals of the future, whose privacy, freedom of expression, economic opportunity, and property rights could be foreclosed in a Cyberspace of this design. Indeed, it calls into question whether in the future the individual will count for very much at all.

Arising on the electronic frontier are questions which are subtle, profound, and of fundamental importance to the way tomorrow's society will function. With this column I hope to raise those questions and offer my own modest speculations about how we might begin the process of answering them.

This column will are also concern itself with the development of a new social contract for the digital domain... sort of a Cyberspace equivalent to the Code of the West... and an attendant definition of the rights and responsibilities of the inhabitants. I also hope to help create an awareness of the cultural implications of electronic design. And, finally, I want to propose some fundamental revision of our notions of speech, property, and place.

Big stuff. And easily ignored on that account. But a new world is being born. Uncorrected flaws in its design will scale up along with the rest of it. Today's minor misjudgements will become tomorrow's established horrors.

An example from the past might serve to illuminate this point. In the early days of broadcasting, the government decided that the airwaves (as well as the frequency resolution of crystal set receivers) had such limited bandwidth that it would be necessary for the government to license broadcasters. Well and good. However, someone also decided that if the government were going to regulate frequency allocation, it should regulate content as well.

Thus what is today the most common form of expression exists under constraints of governmental censorship which the founding fathers would have found intolerable, all because of bureaucratic error which, at the time, seemed too insignificant to correct.

Similar errors are being made today around the subject of intellectual property and its interstate transport. In our zeal to protect this stuff as though it were tangible as pig iron, we are enacting laws and regulations which will almost certainly limit free expression in the future unless we fix the system now. (See Dorothy Denning's article about Phrack in this issue for a good example of what I'm talking about.)

Pretending that it ain't broke sure won't fix it, but, in the numerous discussions I've had with members of the computer community, there doesn't seem to be much willingness to tackle these issues at any depth. Most of you have your attentions so firmly fixed on the concrete business at hand... and important business it usually is... that it's hard to find time for shadow-boxing abstractions.

"Hey, I do bus architecture, I'm no social philosopher," is the sort of rejoinder I hear a lot. It's a hard one to argue with. Keep your head down, do what you know, and hope it's all headed someplace good.

Trouble is, the rest of society is so utterly perplexed by digital technology that most ordinary citizens are even less qualified than bus architects to engage in cybernetic social philosophy. As readers of this magazine, you are almost certainly more knowledgeable about the legal and cultural ambiguities surrounding digital communication and property than your computerphobic fellow citizens. You are thus well suited to the task of civilizing Cyberspace. I hope you will join me on the electronic frontier, because I believe it is time for that process to begin consciously.

Whether consciously or unconsciously, we are presently shaping the future ethics and culture of Cyberspace. Only by bringing awareness to this task will we create the sort of place we would want to send our children as settlers.

Pinedale, Wyoming Friday, November 9, 1990

Private Life in Cyberspace

For the June, 1991

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

I have lived most of my life in a small Wyoming town, where there is little of the privacy which both insulates and isolates suburbanites. Anyone in Pinedale who is interested in me or my doings can get most of the information he might seek in the Wrangler Cafe. Between them, any five customers could probably produce all that was known locally about me, including a quite a number of items which were well known but not true.

For most people who have never lived in these conditions, the idea that one's private life might be public knowledge...and, worse, that one's neighbors might fabricate tales about him when the truth would do...is a terrifying thought. Whether they have anything to hide or not (and most everyone harbors something he's not too proud of), they seem to assume that others would certainly employ their private peccadillos against them. But what makes the fishbowl of community tolerable is a general willingness of small towns to forgive in their own all that should be forgiven. One is protected from the malice of his fellows not by their lack of dangerous information about him but by their disinclination to use it.

I found myself thinking a lot about this during a recent San Francisco conference on Computers, Privacy, and Freedom. Like most of the attendees, I had arrived there bearing the assumption that there was some necessary connection between privacy and freedom and that among the challenges to which computers may present to our future liberties was their ability to store, transfer, and duplicate the skeletons from our closets.

With support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Apple Computer, the WELL, and a number of other organizations, the conference was put on by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a group which has done much to secure to Americans the ownership of their private lives.Their Man in Washington, Marc Rotenberg, hit the hot key which resulted in Lotus getting 30,000 letters, phone calls, and e-mail messages protesting the release of Lotus Marketplace: Households.

In case you haven't left your terminal in awhile, this was a product whose CD-ROM's of addresses and demographic information would have ushered in the era of Desktop Junkmail. Suddenly anyone with 600 bucks and a CD-ROM drive could have been stuffing your mailbox with their urgent appeals.

Marketplace withered under the heat, and I didn't hear a soul mourn its passage. Most people seemed happy to leave the massive marketing databases in institutional hands, thinking perhaps that junkmail might be one province where democracy was better left unspread.

I wasn't so sure. For example, it occurred to me that Lotus could make a strong legal, if not commercial, case that Marketplace was a publication protected by the First Amendment. It also seemed that a better approach to the scourge of junkmail might be political action directed toward getting the Postal Service to raise its rates on bulk mailing. (Or perhaps even eliminating the Postal Service, which seems to have little function these days beyond the delivery of instant landfills.) Finally, I wondered if we weren't once again blaming the tool and not the workman, as though the problem were information and not its misuse. I felt myself gravitating toward the politically incorrect side of the issue, and so I kept quiet about it.

At the Conference on Computers, Privacy, and Freedom, the no one was keeping quiet. Speaker after speaker painted a picture of gathering informational fascism in which Big Brother was entering our homes dressed in the restrained Italian suit of the Marketroid. Our every commercial quiver was being recorded, collated, and widely redistributed. One began to imagine a Cyberspace smeared all over with his electronic fingerprints, each of them gradually growing into a full-blown virtual image of himself as Potential Customer. I could see an almost infinite parade of my digital simulacra marching past an endless wall of billboards.

There was discussion of opting out of the databases, getting through modern American life without ever giving out one's National Identity Number (as the Social Security Number has indisputably become by default), endeavoring to restrict one's existence to the physical world. The poor fellow from Equifax mouthed smooth corporatisms about voluntary restraints on the secondary use of information...such practices as selling the fact of one's purchase from one catalog to fifteen other aspirants...but no one believed him. Everyone seemed to realize that personal information was as much a commodity as pork bellies, fuel oil, or crack and that the market would be served.

They were right. In the week following the Conference, I got a solicitation from CACI Marketing Systems which began: Now Available! Actual 1990 Census Data. This despite Department of Commerce assurances that Census Data would not be put to commercial use. Marketplace is dead. Long live Marketplace.

When it came down to solutions, however, there seemed to be developing a canonical approach which was all too familiar: let's write some laws. The European Community's privacy standards, scheduled to be implemented by the member nations in 1992, were praised. Similar legislation was proposed for the United States.

Quite apart from the impracticality of entrusting to government another tough problem (given its fairly undistinguished record in addressing the environmental, social, or educational responsibilities it already has), there is a good reason to avoid this strategy. Legally assuring the privacy of one's personal data involves nothing less than endowing the Federal Government with the right to restrict information.

It may be that there is a profound incompatibility between the requirements of privacy (at least as achieved by this methods) and the requirements of liberty. It doesn't take a paranoid to believe that restrictions placed on one form of information will expand to include others. Nor does it take a Libertarian to believe that the imposition of contraband on a commodity probably won't eliminate its availability. I submit, as Exhibit A, the War on Some Drugs.

I began to envision an even more dystopian future in which the data cops patrolled Cyberspace in search of illicit personal info, finding other items of legal interest along the way. Meanwhile, institutions who could afford the elevated price of illegal goods would continue to buy it from thuggish Data Cartels in places like the Turks and Caicos Islands, as sf-writer Bruce Sterling predicted in Islands in the Net.

I returned to Wyoming in a funk. My ghostly electronic selves increased their number on my way home as I bought airline tickets, charged to my credit cards, make long distance phone calls, and earned another speeding ticket. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that nothing short of a fugitive cash-based existence would prevent their continued duplication. And even that would never exorcise them all. I was permanently on record.

Back in Pinedale, where I am also on record, my head started to clear. Barring government regulation of information, for which I have no enthusiasm, it seemed inevitable that the Global Village would resemble a real village at least in the sense of eliminating the hermetic sealing of one's suburban privacy. Everyone would start to lead as public a life as I do at home.

And in that lies at least a philosophical vector towards long-term social solution. As I say, I am protected in Pinedale not by the restriction of information but by a tolerant social contract which prohibits its use against me. (Unless, of course, it's of such a damning nature that it ought to be used against me.) What may be properly restricted by government is not the tool but the work that is done with it. If we don't like junkmail, we should make it too expensive to send. If we don't trust others not to hang us by our errors, we must work to build a more tolerant society.

But this approach has a fundamental limit on its effectiveness. While it may, over the long run, reduce the suffering of marketing targets, it does little to protect one from the excesses of a more authoritarian government than the one we have today. This Republic was born in the anonymous broadsides of citizens who published them under Latinate pseudonyms like Publius Civitatus. How would the oppressed citizens of the electronic future protect the source of rebellion?

Furthermore, much of the tolerance which I experience in Pinedale has to do with the fact that we experience one another here. We are not abstracted into information, which, no matter how dense it becomes, is nothing to grow a human being from. And it will be a long time before we exist in Cyberspace as anything but information.

While I generally resist technical solutions to social problems, it seems best approach to this digital dilemma is also machine-based: encryption. At the CFP Conference, EFF co-founder John Gilmore called on the computer industry to include in their products tools which would enhance the privacy of their communications. These might include hardware-based public key encryption schemes, though these are probably too narrow in scale to cover the whole problem.

He also noted that it is possible to have an electronic identity which is not directly connected to one's physical self. I agree with him that it is not only possible but advisable. From the standpoint of credit assurance, there is no difference between the information that John Perry Barlow always pays his bills on time or that Account #345 8849 23433 (to whomever that may belong) is equally punctilious.

There are, of course, a number of problems with encrypted identity, not the least of which the development of a long-term credit record attached to disembodied number. And keeping that number disembodied over the same long term is not a trivial enterprise. Finally, there is the old political question..."What are you trying to hide?"...in which the effort to conceal is taken to be a statement of guilt. This might limit a willingness on the part of information carriers to engage in the compliance necessary to make this system work.

Of course, neither machine-based encryption systems nor encrypted identities will become reality unless the computer, communications, and information industries perceive there to be technically feasible methods of providing these services and people willing to pay for them. ACM members are well situated to provide both the technology and the initial market for it.

And, as usual, we would be well-advised to keep of abreast of political developments. As I write this, there are before congress a Couple of bills which would render encryption meaningless. Senator Joseph Biden has introduced Senate Bill 266 which declares:

It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law.

It appears that the FBI's concern in requesting this language was the difficulty of tapping multiplexed phone lines, but the bill nevertheless says, "turn over your encryption keys." These words probably won't become law, but even if they don't, it seems certain that we haven't seen the last of them, inasmuch as similar language is also to be found in S. 618, The Violent Crime Control Act of 1991. Both of these bills address a legitimate law-enforcement concern: how to build a case when all the evidence is encrypted, but as in other areas of information vs. action, they should place their focus on the dirty deed and not the planning of it.

Another legislative vicinity to watch are efforts to amend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to address more adequately cellular and other wireless technologies. This is especially relevant since, as Nicholas Negroponte has predicted, information which has traditionally flowed through cables, like telephone conversations, are taking to the air while broadcast information is moving underground. Entirely different assumptions prevail between broadcast and one-to-one communications which will now be questioned legally and technically.

EFF believes that legal constraints on intercepting private wireless communications will not be sufficient to address the problem. Cellular manufacturers and service providers must be urged provide their customers with the cheap encryption methods which are already available. At the same time, they should be legally required to inform their customers of the easy interception of non-encrypted communications. Finally, in our zeal to protect the privacy of cellular conversation, we should be careful not to criminalize simple scanning of the airwaves, most of which has no specific target or intent, lest we pass laws which inhibit access to information.

All in all, we are looking at some tough challenges, both technologically and politically. Computer technology has created not just a new medium but a new place. The society we erect there will probably be quite different from the one we now inhabit, given the fact that this one depends heavily on the physical property of things while the next one has no physical properties at all. Certain qualities should survive the transfer, however, and these include tolerance, respect for privacy of others, and a willingness to treat one's fellows as something besides potential customers.

But until we have developed the Social Contract of Cyberspace, we must create, though encryption and related means, the virtual envelopes and rooms within which we can continue to lead private lives as we enter this new and very public place. Pinedale, Wyoming March 30, 1991

The Great Work

For the January, 1992

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

Earlier in this century, the French philosopher and anthropologist Teilhard de Chardin wrote that evolution was an ascent toward what he called "The Omega Point," when all consciousness would converge into unity, creating the collective organism of Mind. When I first encountered the Net, I had forgotten my college dash through Teilhard's Phenomenon of Man. It took me a while to remember where I'd first encountered the idea of this immense and gathering organism.

Whether or not it represents Teilhard's vision, it seems clear we are about some Great Work here...the physical wiring of collective human consciousness. The idea of connecting every mind to every other mind in full-duplex broadband is one which, for a hippie mystic like me, has clear theological implications, despite the ironic fact that most of the builders are bit wranglers and protocol priests, a proudly prosaic lot. What Thoughts will all this assembled neurology, silicon, and optical fiber Think?

Teilhard was a Roman Catholic priest who never tried to forge a SLIP connection, so his answers to that question were more conventionally Christian than mine, but it doesn't really matter. We'll build it and then we'll find out.

And however obscure our reasons, we do seem determined to build it. Since 1970, when the Arpanet was established, it has become, as Internet, one of the largest and fastest growing creations in the history of human endeavor. Internet is now expanding as much as 25% a month, a curve which plotted on a linear trajectory would put every single human being online in a few decades.

Or, more likely, not. Indeed, what we seem to be making at the moment is something which will unite only the corporate, military, and academic worlds, excluding the ghettos, hick towns, and suburbs where most human minds do their thinking. We are rushing toward a world in which there will be Knows, constituting the Wired Mind, and the Know Nots, who will count for little but the labor and consumption necessary to support it.

If that happens, the Great Work will have failed, since, theological issues aside, its most profound consequence should be the global liberation of everyone's speech. A truly open and accessible Net will become an environment of expression which no single government could stifle.

When Mitch Kapor and I first founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we were eager to assure that the rights established by the First Amendment would be guaranteed in Cyberspace. But it wasn't long before we realized that in such borderless terrain, the First Amendment is a local ordinance.

While we haven't abandoned a constitutional strategy in assuring free digital commerce, we have also come to recognize that, as Mitch put it, "Architecture is politics." In other words, if the Net is ubiquitous, affordable, easy to access, tunnelled with encrypted passageways, and based on multiple competitive channels, no local tyranny will be very effective against it.

A clear demonstration of this principle was visible during the recent coup in the Soviet Union. Because of the decentralized and redundant nature of digital media, it was impossible for the geriatric plotters in the Kremlin to suppress the delivery of truth. Faxes and e-mail messages kept the opposition more current with developments than the KGB, with its hierarchical information systems, could possibly be. Whatever legal restraints the aspiring dictators might have imposed were impotent against the natural anarchy of the Net.

Well, I could have myself a swell time here soliloquizing about such notions as the Great Work or the assurance of better living through electronics, but all great journeys proceed by tedious increments. Though the undertaking is grand, it is the nuts and bolts...the regulatory and commercial politics, the setting of standards, the technical acceleration of bits...that matter. They are so complex and boring as to erode the most resolute enthusiasm, but if they don't get done, It doesn't.

So we need to be thinking about what small steps must be undertaken today. Even while thinking globally, we must begin, as the bumper sticker fatuously reminds us, by acting locally. Which is why I will focus the remainder of this column on near-term conditions, opportunities, and preferred courses of action within the boundaries of the United States.

To a large extent, America is the Old Country of Cyberspace. The first large interconnected networks were developed here as was much of the supporting technology. Leaving aside the estimable French Minitel system, Cyberspace is, in is present condition, highly American in culture and language. Though fortunately this is increasingly less the case, much of the infrastructure of the Net still sits on American soil. For this reason, the United States remains the best place to enact the policies upon which the global electronic future will be founded.

In the opinion of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the first order of business is the creation of what we call the National Public Network...named with the hope that the word "National" should become obsolete as soon as possible. By this, we mean a ubiquitous digital web, accessible to every American in practical, economic, and functional terms. This network would convey, in addition to traditional telephone service, e-mail, software, faxes, such multimedia forms of communication as "video postcards," and, in time, High Definition Television as well as other media as yet barely imagined.

Its services should be extended by a broad variety of providers, including the existing telephone, cable, publishing, broadcast, and digital network companies. Furthermore, if its architecture is appropriately open to free enterprise, we can expect the emergence of both new companies and new kinds of companies. Properly designed, the National Public Network will constitute a market for goods and services which will make the $100 billion a year personal computer business look like a precursor to the Real Thing.

As a first step, we are proposing that Congress and state agencies establish regulatory mechanisms and incentives that will:

\\* Establish an open platform for information services by speedy nation-wide deployment of "Personal ISDN".

\\* Ensure competition in local exchange services in order to provide equitable access to communications media.

\\* Promote free expression by reaffirming principles of common carriage.

\\* Foster innovations that make networks and information services easier to use.

\\* Protect personal privacy.

That's a tall bill, most of which I will have to take up in subsequent columns. I will focus now on the first two.

Personal ISDN

For the last two years, the Internet community has generally regarded Senator Albert Gore's proposed National Research and Education Network as the next major component of the Great Work. This has been regrettable. NREN, as presently envisioned, would do little to enable the settlement of ordinary folks in Cyberspace. Rather it would make plusher accommodations for the "mountain men" already there.

Actually, NREN has been and may continue to be useful as a "policy testbed." By giving Congress a reason to study such legal connundra as unregulated common carriage and the intermingling of public and private networks, NREN may not be a waste of time and focus. But, as of this writing, it has become a political football. If the House version (H656) of the High Performance Computing Act passes with Dick Gephart's "Buy American" provisions in it, the Administration will surely veto it, and we'll be back to Square One.

Meanwhile, ISDN, a technology available today, has languished. ISDN or Integrated Services Digital Network is a software-based system based on standard digital switching. Using ISDN, an ordinary copper phone line can provide two full-duplex 64 kbs digital channels. These can be used independently, concurrently, and simultaneously for voice and/or data. (Actually, it's a bit more complex than that. Garden variety ISDN contains three channels. The third is a 16 kbs "signal" channel, used for dialing and other services.)

It isn't new technology, and, unlike fiber and wireless systems, it requires little additional infrastructure beyond the digital switches, which most telcos, under an FCC mandate, have installed anyway or will install soon. Even at the currently languid development rate, the telcos estimate that 60% of the nation's phones could be ISND ready in two years.

While those who live their lives at the end of a T1 connection may consider 64 kbs to be a glacial transfer rate, the vast majority of digital communications ooze along at a pace twenty-seven times slower, or 2400 baud. We believe that the ordinary modem is both too slow and too user-hostile to create "critical mass" in the online market.

We also believe that ISDN, whatever its limitations, is rapid enough to jump start the greatest free market the world has ever known. Widespread deployment of ISDN, combined with recent developments in compression technology, could break us out of what Adobe's John Warnock calls the "ascii jail", delivering to the home graphically rich documents, commercial software objects, and real-time multimedia. Much of the information which is now inappropriately wedged into physical objects...whether books, shrink-wrapped software, videos, or CD's...would enter the virtual world, its natural home. Bringing consumers to Cyberspace would have the same invigorating effect on online technology which the advent of the PC had on computing.

We admit that over the long term only fiber has sufficient bandwidth for the future we imagine. But denying "civilian" access to Cyberspace until the realization of a megabillion buck end-to-end fiber network leaves us like the mainframe users in the 60's waiting for the supercomputer. The real juice came not from the Big Iron but from user adaptable consumer "toys" like the Apple II and the original PC.

Just as consumers were oblivious to the advantages of FAX technology until affordable equipment arrived, we believe there is a great sleeping demand for both ISDN and the tools which will exploit it. And then there's the matter of affording the full fiber national network. Until the use of digital services has become as common as, say, the use of VCR's, Joe Sixpack's willingness to help pay fiber's magnificent cost will be understandably restrained.

Given that most personal modem users are unaware that ISDN even exists while the old elite of Internet grossly underestimates its potential benefits, it's not surprising that the telcos have been able to claim lack of consumer demand in their reluctance to make it available. A cynic might also point to its convenience as a hostage in their struggles with Judge Green and the newspaper publishers. They wanted into the information business and something like "Allow us to be information providers or we starve this technology," has been one of their longest levers.

This issue should now be moot. Judge Greene ruled in July that the telcos could start selling information. They got what they wanted. Now we must make them honor their side of the bargain.

Unfortunately it still seems they will only let us use their playing field if they can be guaranteed to win the game. To this end, they have managed to convince several state Public Utility Commissions that they should be allowed to charge tariffs for ISDN delivery which are grotesquely disproportionate to its actual costs. In Illinois, for example, customers are paying 10 to 12 cents a minute for an ISDN connection. This, despite evidence that the actual telco cost of a digitally switched phone connection, whether voice or data, runs at about a penny a minute. Even in the computer business, 1200% is not an ethical gross margin. And yet the telcos claim that more appropriate pricing would require pensioners to pay for the plaything of a few computer geeks.

Unfortunately, the computer industry has been either oblivious to the opportunities which ISDN presents or reluctant to enter the regulatory fray before Congress, the FCC, and the PUC's. The latter is understandable. National telecommunications policy has long been an in-house project of AT&T. It is brain-glazingly prolix by design and is generally regarded as a game you can't win unless you're on the home team. The AT&T breakup changed all that, but the industry has been slow to catch on.

Assurance of Local Competition

In the wake of Ma Bell's dismemberment, the world is a richer and vastly more complex place. Who provides what services to whom, and under what conditions, is an open question in most local venues. Even with a scorecard you can't tell the players since many of them don't exist yet.

Legislation is presently before the Edward Markey's (D-MA) Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance (a subset of the House Energy and Commerce Committee) which would regulate the entry of the Regional Bells into the information business. The committee is correctly concerned that the RBOC's will use their infrastructure advantage to freeze out information providers. In other words, rather as Microsoft uses DOS and Windows.

Somewhat hysterical over this prospect, the Newspaper Publishers Association and the cable television companies have seen to the introduction of a House Bill 3515 by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-TN) which would essentially cripple telco delivery of information services for the next decade. The bill would bar existing telephone service providers from information provision until 50% of subscribers in a given area had access to alternative infrastructures.

Of course neither approach would serve the public interest. The telcos have had so little experience with competition that we can't expect them to welcome it. And while eventually there will be local phone connection competition through wireless technologies, it's silly to wait until that distant day.

We need a bill which would require the telcos to make ISDN open and affordable to all information providers, conditioning their entry into the information business to the willing delivery of such service.

The computer industry has an opportunity to break the gridlock between the telcos and the publishers. By representing consumer interests, which are, in this case, equivalent to our own, we can shape legislation which would be to everyone's benefit. What's been missing in the debate has been technical expertise which serves neither of the existing contenders.

Finally, the Public Utilities Commissions seem unaware of the hidden potential demand for digital services to the home. What on earth would a housewife want with a 64 kbs data line? This is another area in which both consumers and computer companies need to be heard from.

What You Can Do

Obviously, the first task upon entering a major public campaign is informing oneself and others. In this, many Communications readers have a great advantage. Most of us have access to such online fora as RISKS digest, Telecom Digest, and the EFFectors regularly published in the EFF's newsgroup comp.org.eff.news. I strongly recommend that those interested in assisting this effort begin monitoring those newsgroups. I'm tempted to tell you to join the EFF and support our Washington lobbying efforts, but I probably abuse this podium with our message too much as it is.

Once you're up to speed on these admittedly labyrinthine issues, there are three levers you can start leaning against.

First, Congress will be actively studying these matters for the remainder of the year and is eagerly soliciting viewpoints other than those self-servingly extended by the telcos and the publishers. Rep. Markey said recently in a letter to the EFF,

"Please let me and my staff know what policies you and others in the computer industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating a reasonably priced, widely available network, in which competition is open and innovation is rewarded. I also want to learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past 10 to 15 years should apply to the current debate on structuring the information and communication networks of the future."

Second, it is likely that the Public Utility Commission in your state will be taking up the question of ISDN service and rates sometime in the next year. They will likely be grateful for your input.

Finally, you can endeavor to make your own company aware of the opportunities which ISDN deployment will provide it as well as the political obstacles to its provision. No matter what region of the computer business employs your toils, ISDN will eventually provide a new market for its products.

Though these matters are still on the back pages of public awareness, we are at the threshold of one of the great passages in the history of both computing and telecommunications. This is the eve of the electronic frontier's first land rush, a critical moment for The Great Work.

Decrypting the Puzzle Palace

For the June, 1992

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

"A little sunlight is the best disinfectant."--Justice Louis Brandeis Over a year ago, in a condition of giddier innocence than I enjoy today, I wrote the following about the discovery of Cyberspace:

"Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no other side. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate which expands with development."

One less felicitous feature of this terrain which I hadn't noticed then is what seems to be a long-encamped and immense army of occupation.

This army represents interests which are difficult to define, guards the area against unidentified enemies, meticulously observes almost every activity undertaken there, and continuously prevents most who inhabit its domain from drawing any blinds against such observation.

It marshals at least 40,000 troops, owns the most advanced computing resources in the world, and uses funds the dispersal of which does not fall under any democratic review.

Imagining this force won't require from you the inventive powers of a William Gibson. The American Occupation Army of Cyberspace exists. Its name is the National Security Agency.

It may be argued that this peculiar institution inhibits free trade, has directly damaged American competitiveness, and poses a threat to liberty anywhere people communicate with electrons. It's principal function, as my EFF colleague John Gilmore puts it, is "wire-tapping the world," which it is free to do without a warrant from any judge.

It is legally constrained from domestic surveillance, but precious few people are in a good position to watch what, how, or whom the NSA watches. And those who are tend to be temperamentally sympathetic to its objectives and methods. They like power, and power understands the importance of keeping it own secrets and learning everyone else's.

Whether it is meticulously ignoring every American byte or not, the NSA is certainly pursuing policies which will render our domestic affairs transparent to anyone who can afford big digital hardware. Such policies could have profound consequences on our liberty and privacy.

More to point, the role of the NSA in the area of domestic privacy needs to be assessed in the light of other recent federal initiatives which seem directly aimed at permanently denying privacy to the inhabitants of Cyberspace, whether foreign or American.

Finally it seems a highly opportune time, directly following our disorienting victory in the Cold War, to ask if the threats from which the NSA purportedly protects us from are as significant as the hazards its activities present.

Like most Americans I'd never given much thought to the NSA until recently. (Indeed its very existence was a secret for much of my life. Beltway types used to joke that NSA stood for "No Such Agency.")

I vaguely knew that it was another of the 12 or so shadowy federal spook houses which were erected shortly after the Iron Curtain with the purpose of stopping its further advance. It derives entirely from a memorandum sent by Harry Truman on October 24, 1952 to Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Defense Secretary Robert Lovatt. This memo, the official secrecy of which remained unpenetrated for almost 40 years, created the NSA, placed it under the authority of the Secretary of Defense, and charged it with monitoring and decoding any signal transmission relevant to the security of the United States.

Even after I started noticing the NSA, my natural immunity to paranoia combined with a general belief in the incompetence of all bureaucracies...especially those whose inefficiencies are unmolested by public scrutiny...to mute any sense of alarm. But this was before I began to understand the subterranean battles raging over data encryption and the NSA's role in them. Lately, I'm less sanguine.

As I mentioned in a previous column (Private Life in Cyberspace, August 1991), encryption may be the only reliable method for conveying privacy to the inherently public domain of Cyberspace. I certainly trust it more than privacy protection laws. Relying on government to protect your privacy is like asking a peeping tom to install your window blinds.

In fact, we already have a strong-sounding federal law protecting our electronic privacy, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or ECPA. But this law has not particular effective in those areas were electronic eavesdropping is technically easy. This is especially true in the area of cellular phone conversations, which, under the current analog transmission standard, are easily accessible to anyone from the FBI to you.

The degree of law enforcement apprehension over secure cellular encryption provides mute evidence of how seriously they've been taking ECPA. They are moving on a variety of fronts to see that robust electronic privacy protection systems don't become generally available to the public. Indeed, the current administration may be so determined to achieve this end that they may be willing to paralyze progress in America's most promising technologies rather than yield on it.

Push is coming to shove in two areas of communications technology: digital transmission of heretofore analog signals and the encryption of transmitted data.

As the communications service providers move to packet switching, fiber optic transmission lines, digital wireless, ISDN and other advanced techniques, what have been discrete channels of continuous electrical impulses, voices audible to anyone with alligator clips on the right wires, are now becoming chaotic blasts of data packets, readily intelligible only to the sender and receiver. This development effectively forecloses traditional wire-tapping techniques, even as it provides new and different opportunities for electronic surveillance.

It is in the latter area where the NSA knows its stuff. A fair percentage of the digital signals dispatched on planet Earth must pass at some point through the NSA's big sieve in Fort Meade, Maryland, 12 underground acres of the heaviest hardware in the computing world. There, unless these packets are also encrypted with a particularly knotty algorithm, sorting them back back into their original continuity is not so difficult.

Last spring, alarmed at a future in which it would have to sort through an endless fruit salad of encrypted bits, the FBI persuaded Senator Joseph Biden to include language in Senate Bill 266 which would have directed providers of electronic communications services and devices (such as digital cellular phone systems or other multiplexed communications channels) to implement only such encryption methods as would assure governmental ability to extract from the data stream the plaintext of any voice or data communications in which it took a legal interest. It was if the government had responded to a technological leap in lock design by requiring building contractors to supply it with skeleton keys to every door in America.

The provision raised wide-spread concern in the computer community, which was better equipped to understand its implications than the general public, and in August of last year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in cooperation with Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and other industry groups, successfully lobbied to have it removed from the bill.

Our celebration was restrained. I knew we knew we hadn't seen the last of it. For one thing, the movement to digital communications does create some serious obstacles to traditional wire-tapping procedures. I fully expected that law enforcement would be back with new proposals, which I hoped might be ones we could support. But what I didn't understand then, and am only now beginning to appreciate, was the extent to which this issue had already been engaged by the NSA in the obscure area of export controls over data encryption algorithms.

Encryption algorithms, despite their purely defensive characteristics, have been regarded by the government of this country as weapons of war for many years. If they are to be employed for privacy (as opposed to authentication) and they are any good at all, their export is licensed under State Department's International Traffic in Arms Regulations or ITAR.

The encryption watchdog is the NSA. It has been enforcing a policy, neither debated nor even admitted to, which holds that if a device or program contains an encryption scheme which the NSA can't break fairly easily, it will not be licensed for international sale.

Aside for marvelling at the silliness of trying to embargo algorithms, a practice about as practicable as restricting the export of wind, I didn't pay much attention to the implications of NSA encryption policies until February of this year. It was then that I learned about the deliberations of an an obscure group of cellular industry representatives called the Ad Hoc Authentication Task Force, TR45.3 and of the influence which the NSA has apparently exercised over their findings.

In the stately fashion characteristic of standard-setting bodies, this group has been working for several years on a standard for digital cellular transmission, authentication, and privacy protection to be known by the characteristically whimsical telco moniker IS-54B.

In February they met near Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. At that meeting, they recommended, and agreed not to publish, an encryption scheme for American-made digital cellular systems which many sophisticated observers believe to be intentionally vulnerable. It was further thought by many observers that this "dumbing down" had been done in direct cooperation with the NSA.

Given the secret nature of the new algorithm, its actual merits were difficult to assess. But many cryptologists believe there is enough in the published portions of the standard to confirm that it isn't any good.

One cryptographic expert, one of two I spoke with who asked not to be identified lest the NSA take reprisals against his company, said:

"The voice privacy scheme , as opposed to the authentication scheme, is pitifully easy to break. It involves the generation of two "voice privacy masks" each 260 bits long. They are generated as a byproduct of the authentication algorithm and remain fixed for the duration of a call. The voice privacy masks are exclusive\_ORed with each frame of data from the vocoder at the transmitter. The receiver XORs the same mask with the incoming data frame to recover the original plaintext. Anyone familiar with the fundamentals of cryptanalysis can easily see how weak this scheme is."

And indeed, Whitfield Diffie, co-inventor of Public Key cryptography and arguably the dean of this obscure field, told me this about the fixed masks:

"Given that description of the encryption process, there is no need for the opponents to know how the masks were generated. Routine cryptanalytic operations will quickly determine the masks and remove them.''

Some on committee claimed that possible NSA refusal of export licensing had no bearing on the algorithm they chose. But their decision not to publish the entire method and expose it to cryptanalytical abuse (not to mention ANSI certification) was accompanied by the following convoluted justification:

"It is the belief of the majority of the Ad Hoc Group, based on our current understanding of the export requirements, that a published algorithm would facilitate the cracking of the algorithm to the extent that its fundamental purpose is defeated or compromised." (Italics added.)

Now this is a weird paragraph any way you parse it, but its most singular quality is the sudden, incongruous appearance of export requirements in a paragraph otherwise devoted to algorithmic integrity. In fact, this paragraph is itself code, the plaintext of which goes something like this: "We're adopting this algorithm because, if we don't, the NSA will slam an export embargo on all domestically manufactured digital cellular phones."

Obviously, the cellular phone systems manufacturers and providers are not going to produce one model for overseas sale and another for domestic production. Thus, a primary effect of NSA-driven efforts to deny some unnamed foreign enemy secure cellular communications is on domestic security. The wireless channels available to private Americans will be cloaked in a mathematical veil so thin that, as one crypto-expert put it, "Any county sheriff with the right PC-based black box will be able to monitor your cellular conversations."

When I heard him say that, it suddenly became clear to me that, whether consciously undertaken with that goal or not, the most important result of the NSA's encryption embargoes has been the future convenience of domestic law enforcement. Thanks to NSA export policies, they will be assured that, as more Americans protect their privacy with encryption, it will be of a sort easily penetrated by authority.

I find it increasingly hard to imagine this is not their real objective as well. Surely, they must be aware of how ineffectual their efforts have been in keeping good encryption out of inimical military possession. An algorithm is somewhat less easily stopped at the border than, say, a nuclear reactor. As William Neukom, head of Microsoft Legal puts it, "The notion that you can control this technology is comical."

I became further persuaded that this was the case upon hearing, from a couple of sources, that the Russians have been using the possibly uncrackable (and American) RSA algorithm in their missile launch codes for the last ten years and that, for as little as five bucks, one can get a software package called Crypto II on the streets of Saint Petersburg which includes both RSA and DES encryption systems.

Nevertheless, the NSA has been willing to cost American business a lot of revenue rather than allow domestic products with strong encryption into the global market.

While it's impossible to set a credible figure on what that loss might add up to, it's high. Jim Bidzos, whose RSA Data Security licenses RSA, points to one major Swiss bid in which a hundred million dollar contract for financial computer terminals went to a European vendor after American companies were prohibited by the NSA from exporting a truly secure network.

The list of export software containing intentionally broken encryption is also long. Lotus Notes ships in two versions. Don't count on much protection from the encryption in the export version. Both Microsoft and Novell have been thwarted in their efforts to include RSA in their international networking software, despite frequent publication of the entire RSA algorithm in technical publications all over the world.

With hardware, the job has been easier. NSA levied against the inclusion of a DES chip in the AS/390 series IBM mainframes in late 1990 despite the fact that, by this time, DES was in widespread use around the world, including semi-official adoption by our official enemy, the USSR.

I now realize that Soviets have not been the NSA's main concern at any time lately. Naively hoping that, with the collapse of the Evil Empire, the NSA might be out of work, I then learned that, given their own vigorous crypto systems and their long use of some embargoed products, the Russians could not have been the threat from whom this forbidden knowledge was to be kept. Who has the enemy been then? I started to ask around.

Cited again and again as the real object of the embargoes were Third-World countries. terrorists and... criminals. Criminals, most generally drug-flavored, kept coming up, and nobody seemed terribly concerned that some of their operations might be located in areas supposedly off-limits to NSA scrutiny.

Presumably the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) and a series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.

But whether or not FISA has actually limited the NSA's abilities to conduct domestic surveillance seemed less relevant the more I thought about it. A better question to ask was, "Who is best served by the NSA's encryption export policies?" The answer is clear: domestic law enforcement. Was this the result of some spook plot between NSA and, say, the Department of Justice? Not necessarily.

Certainly in the case of the digital cellular standard, cultural congruity between foreign intelligence, domestic law enforcement, and what somebody referred to as "spook wannabes on the TR45.3 committee" might have a lot more to do with the its eventual flavor than any actual whisperings along the Potomac.

Unable to get anyone presently employed by the NSA to comment on this or any other matter and with little opportunity to assess the NSA's congeniality toward domestic law enforcement from the inside, I approached a couple of old hands for a highly distilled sample of intelligence culture.

I called Admirals Stansfield Turner and Bobby Ray Inman. Not only had their Carter administration positions as, respectively, CIA and NSA Directors, endowed them with considerable experience in such matters, both are generally regarded to be somewhat more sensitive to the limits of democratic power than their successors. None of whom seemed likely to return my calls anyway.

My phone conversations with Turner and Inman were amiable enough, but they didn't ease my gathering sense that the NSA takes an active interest in areas which are supposedly beyond its authorized field of scrutiny.

Turner started out by saying he was in no position to confirm or deny any suspicions about direct NSA-FBI cooperation on encryption, but he didn't think I was being exactly irrational in raising the question. In fact, he genially encouraged me to investigate the matter further.

He also said that while a sub rosa arrangement between the NSA and the Department of Justice to compromise domestic encryption would be "injudicious," he could think of no law, including FISA (which he helped design), which would prevent it.

Most alarmingly, this gentleman who has written eloquently on the hazards of surveillance in a democracy did not seem terribly concerned that our digital shelters are being rendered permanently translucent by and to the government.

He said, "A threat could develop...terrorism, narcotics, whatever...where the public would be pleased that all electronic traffic was open to decryption. You can't legislate something which forecloses the possibility of meeting that kind of emergency."

Admiral Inman had even more enthusiasm for assertive governmental supervision. Although he admitted no real knowledge of the events behind the new cellular encryption standard, he wasn't the least disturbed to hear that it might be flawed.

And, despite the fact that his responsibilities as NSA Director had been restricted to foreign intelligence, he seemed a lot more comfortable talking about threats on the home front.

"The Department of Justice," he began, "has a very legitimate worry. The major weapon against white collar crime has been the court-ordered wiretap. If the criminal elements go to using a high quality cipher, the principal defense against narcotics traffic is gone." This didn't sound like a guy who, were he still head of NSA, would rebuff FBI attempts to get a little help from his agency.

He brushed off my concerns about the weakness of the cellular encryption standard. "If all you're seeking is personal privacy, you can get that with a very minimal amount of encipherment."

Well, I wondered, Privacy from whom?

And he seemed to regard real, virile encryption to be something rather like a Saturday Night Special. "My answer," he said, "would be legislation which would make it a criminal offense to use encrypted communication to conceal criminal activity."

Wouldn't that render all encrypted traffic automatically suspect? I asked.

"Well, he said, "you could have a registry of institutions which can legally use ciphers. If you get somebody using one who isn't registered, then you go after him."

You can have my encryption algorithm, I thought to myself, when you pry my cold dead fingers from its private key.

It wasn't a big sample, but it was enough to gain a better appreciation of the cultural climate of the intelligence community. And these guys are the liberals. What legal efficiencies might their Republican successors be willing to employ to protect the American Way?

Without the comfortably familiar presence of the Soviets to hate and fear, we can expect to see a sharp increase in over-rated bogeymen and virtual states of emergency. This is already well under way. I think we can expect our drifting and confused hardliners to burn the Reichstag repeatedly until they have managed to extract from our induced alarm the sort of government which makes them feel safe.

This process has been under way for some time. One sees it in the war on terrorism, against which pursuit "no liberty is absolute," as Admiral Turner put it. This, despite the fact that, during last year for which I have a solid figure, 1987, only 7 Americans succumbed to terrorism.

You can also see it clearly under way in the War on Some Drugs. The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution has largely disappeared in this civil war. And among the people I spoke with, it seemed a common canon that drugs (by which one does not mean Jim Beam, Marlboros, Folger's, or Halcion) were a sufficient evil to merit the government's holding any more keys it felt the need for.

One individual close to the committee said that at least some of the afore-mentioned "spook wannabes" on the committee were "interested in weak cellular encryption because they considered warrants not to be "practical"when it came to pursuing drug dealers and other criminals using cellular phones."

In a miscellaneously fearful America, where the people cry for shorter chains and smaller cages, such privileges as secure personal communications are increasingly regarded as expendable luxuries. As Whitfield Diffie put it, "From the consistent way in which Americans seem to put security ahead of freedom, I rather fear that most of them would prefer that all electronic traffic was open to government decryption right now if they had given it any thought."

In any event, while I found no proof of an NSA-FBI conspiracy to gut the American cellular phone encryption standard, it seemed clear to me that none was needed. The same results can be delivered by a cultural "auto-conspiracy" between like-minded hardliners and cellular companies who will care about privacy only when their customers do.

You don't have to be a hand-wringing libertarian like me to worry about the domestic consequences of the NSA's encryption embargoes. They are also, as stated previously, bad for business, unless, of course, the business of America is no longer business but, as sometimes seems the case these days, crime control.

As Ron Rivest (the "R" in RSA) said to me, "We have the largest information based economy in the world. We have have lots of reasons for wanting to protect information, and weakening our encryption systems for the convenience of law enforcement doesn't serve the national interest."

But by early March, it had become clear that this supposedly business-oriented administration had made a clear choice to favor cops over commerce even if the costs to the American economy were to become extremely high.

A sense of White House seriousness in this regard could be taken from their response to the first serious effort by Congress to bring the NSA to task for its encryption embargoes. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Calif.) proposed an amendment to the Export Administration Act to transfer mass market software controls to the Commerce Department, which would relax the rules. The administration responded by saying that they would veto the entire bill if the Levine amendment remained attached to it.

Even though it appeared the NSA had little to fear from Congress, the Levine amendment may have been part of what placed the agency in a bargaining mood for the first time. They entered into discussions with the Software Publishers Association who, acting primarily on behalf of Microsoft and Lotus, got to them to agree "in principle" to a streamlined process for export licensing of encryption which might provide for more robust standards than have been allowed previously.

But the negotiations between the NSA and the SPA were being conducted behind closed doors, with the NSA-imposed understanding that any agreement they reached would be set forth only in a "confidential" letter to Congress. As in the case of the digital cellular standard, this would eliminate the public scrutiny by cryptography researchers which anneals genuinely hardened encryption.

Furthermore, some cryptographers worried that the encryption key lengths to which the SPA appeared willing to restrict its member publishers might be too short to provide much defense against the sorts of brute-force decryption assaults which advances in processor technology will yield in the fairly near future. And brute force has always been the NSA's strong suit.

Whether accurate or not, the impression engendered by the style of the NSA-SPA negotiations was not one of unassailable confidence. The lack of it will operate to the continued advantage of foreign manufacturers in an era when more and more institutions are going to be concerned about the privacy of their digital communications.

But the economic damage which the NSA-SPA agreement might cause would be minor compared to what would result from a startling new federal initiative, the Department of Justice's proposed legislation on digital telephony. If you're wondering what happened to the snooping provisions which were in Senate Bill 266, look no further. They're back. And they're bigger and bolder than ever.

They are contained in a sweeping proposal which have been made by the Justice Department to the Senate Commerce Committee for legislation which would "require providers of electronic communications services and private branch exchanges to ensure that the Government's ability to lawfully intercept communications is unimpeded by the introduction of advanced digital telecommunications technology or any other telecommunications technology."

Amazingly enough, this really means what it says: before any advance in telecommunications technology can be deployed, the service providers and manufacturers must assure the cops that they can tap into it. In other words, development in digital communications technology must come to a screeching halt until Justice can be assured that it will be able to grab and examine data packets with the same facility they have long enjoyed with analog wire-tapping.

It gets worse. The initiative also provides that, if requested by the Attorney General, "any Commission proceeding concerning regulations, standards or registrations issued or to be issued under authority of thiss ection shall be closed to the public." This essentially places the Attorney General in a position to shut down any telecommunications advance without benefit of public hearing.

When I first heard of the digital telephony proposal, I assumed it was a kind of bargaining chip. I couldn't imagine it was serious. But it now appears they are going to the mattresses on this one.

Taken together with NSA's continued assertion of its authority over encryption, a pattern becomes clear. The government of the United States is so determined to maintain law enforcement's traditional wire-tapping abilities in the digital age that it is willing to fundamentally cripple the American economy to do so. This may sound hyperbolic, but I believe it is not.

The greatest technology advantage this country presently enjoys is in the areas of software and telecommunications. Furthermore, thanks in large part to the Internet, much of America is already wired for bytes, as significant an economic edge in the Information Age as the existence of a railroad system was for England one hundred fifty years ago.

If we continue to permit the NSA to cripple our software and further convey to the Department of Justice the right to stop development the Net without public input, we are sacrificing both our economic future and our liberties. And all in the name of combatting terrorism and drugs.

This has now gone far enough. I have always been inclined to view the American government as pretty benign as such creatures go. I am generally the least paranoid person I know, but there is something scary about a government which cares more about putting its nose in your business than it does about keeping that business healthy.

As I write this, a new ad hoc working group on digital privacy, coordinated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is scrambling to meet the challenge. The group includes representatives from organizations like AT&T, the Regional Bells, IBM, Microsoft, the Electronic Mail Association and about thirty other companies and public interest groups.

Under the direction of Jerry Berman, EFF's Washington office director, and John Podesta, a capable lobbyist and privacy specialist who helped draft the ECPA, this group intends to stop the provisions in digital telephony proposal from entering the statute books.

We also intend to work with federal law enforcement officials to address their legitimate concerns. We don't dispute their need to conduct some electronic surveillance, but we believe this can be assured by more restrained methods than they're proposing.

We are also preparing a thorough examination of the NSA's encryption export policies and looking into the constitutional implications of those policies. Rather than negotiating behind closed doors, as the SPA has been attempting to do, America's digital industries have a strong self-interest in banding together to bring the NSA's procedures and objectives into the sunlight of public discussion.

Finally, we are hoping to open a dialog with the NSA. We need to develop a better understanding of their perception of the world and its threats. Who are they guarding us against and how does encryption fit into that endeavor? Despite our opposition to their policies on encryption export, we assume that NSA operations have some merit. But we would like to be able to rationally balance the merits against the costs.

We strongly encourage any organization which might have a stake in the future of digital communication to become involved. Letters expressing your concern may be addressed to: Sen. Ernest Hollings, Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC and to Don Edwards, Chairman, Subcommitee on Constitutional Rights, House Judiciary Committee. (I would appreciate hearing those concerns myself. Feel free to copy me with those letters at my physical address, c/o P.O. Box 1009, Pinedale, WY 82941 or in Cyberspace, barlow@eff.org.)

If your organization is interested in becoming part of the digital privacy working group, please contact EFF's Washington office at: 666 Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Suite 303, Washington, DC 20003, 202/544-9237, fax: 202/547-5481. EFFs also encourages individuasl interested in these issues to join the organization. Contact us at: Electronic Frontier Foundation, 155 Second Street, Cambridge, MA 02141, 617/864-0665, eff-request@eff.org.

The legal right to express oneself is meaningless if there is no secure medium through which that expression may travel. By the same token, the right to hold certain unpopular opinions is forfeit unless one can discuss those opinions with others of like mind without the government listening in.

Even if you trust the current American government, as I am still largely inclined to, there is a kind of corrupting power in the ability to create public policy in secret while assuring that the public will have little secrecy of its own.

In its secrecy and technological might, the NSA already occupies a very powerful position. And conveying to the Department of Justice what amounts to licensing authority for all communications technology would give it a control of information distribution rarely asserted over English-speaking people since Oliver Cromwell's Star Chamber Proceedings.

Are there threats, foreign or domestic, which are sufficiently grave to merit the conveyance of such vast legal and technological might? And even if the NSA and FBI may be trusted with such power today, will they always be trustworthy? Will we be able to do anything about it if they aren't?

Senator Frank Church said of NSA technology in 1975 words which are more urgent today:

"That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left. There would be no place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny. There would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capacity of this technology."

Will Japan Jack In?

For the October, 1992

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

I am writing this column in a large aluminum tube somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, halfway between El Camino Real and the Ginza. A airliner over the gulf which separates the two parallel universes of the United States and Japan is probably the right "place" to think about culture on the electronic frontier. This is about as virtual an experience as one can have and bring his body along.

There are no landmarks anywhere in this viewshed. The cabin is darkened so the other (mostly Japanese) passengers can watch the American movie, but when I raise the shade and peer below, the sea is featureless and vast as the Net.

The design aesthetics inside this aircraft are classic Generican... as culturally inert as possible. Like most modern American corporate designers, be they decorating Marriotts or the Friendly Skies, the folks who picked these earth tones wished to offend no one, whether American, Japanese or Martian. It's as odorless and colorless as ascii, but it is this very aspect of it, the intentional absence of cultural content, which makes it both so perfectly American and so much in keeping with the rest of the Information Age.

When I first became conscious of the existance of Cyberspace, it didn't immediately dawn on me what an American place...one might even say colony...it is.

An American myself, I didn't find it strange that the Virtual World, from the televised sit-com barrens of the Global Suburbs to the linear vectors of international air traffic control to the Net itself, is a landscape where American English is the lingua franca and American "culture"dominates to the point of invisibility. As McLuhan once observed, "We don't know who it was that discovered water, but we're pretty sure it wasn't a fish."

That this should be the case is not surprising. In addition to being the being birthplace of both telephony and the Internet, America has always had a fascination with blank slates, an impulse to form itself unhindered on the conceptual map rather than adapt to the physical requrements of the landscape.

My first sense that there might be something parochial about my model of the Datasphere arrived not long after the Electronic Frontier Foundation began to make itself known on the Net.

At first, we presented outselves as an organization which primarily intended to assure the application of the First Amendment to digital media. I got a plaintive piece of e-mail from what was still the Soviet Union saying, in effect, "That's all very good, but what about us?" More of the same followed from such precincts as Canada and the United Kingdom. I realized that I had always thought... incorrectly...there was something inherently free about the English language.

Since then, we have placed less emphasis on the easily revised assurances of local law and more on promoting the more robust and natural protections provided by an architecture for Cyberspace which is commercially and technically open, ubiquitous, redundant, and cheap.

But, as I am now discovering, there are other barriers to jacking in which all the fiber, coax, RJ-11 outlets, and sensible rate structures in the world aren't going to overcome immediately. It may be that the most obdurate of these is cultural immune response.

Subtler questions arise. I mean, our aspirations to assure freedom of speech sound noble enough to our own American ears or even recently Soviet sensibilities, but this plane is about to land on an island where dwell millions of people for many of whom freedom of speech is a puzzling irrelevancy.

A Japanese magazine recently requested reprint and translation rights on an essay of mine which deals in part with person's right to speak his or her mind. They are trying to find someone to write an introduction which will attend to the trickier task of cultural translation. As one of their editors told me, "You are preaching the freedom of individuals, but that concept really doesn't exist here, constitutionally or otherwise."

By which I don't mean to suggest that Japan is not a "free country" in our terms. But the very word "free" may mean something profoundly different in a society which is in collective agreement, not due to the imposed ideological will of a despotic bureaucracy, but because they, well...agree.

I sense some restlessness with that agreement in certain surprising precincts of Japanese society. At a conference on globally networked computing in Oita Prefecture in February, I was astonished to hear a number of Japanese corporate officials, apparently orderly as soldiers in their blue pinstripes, proclaim enthusiastically the potential of the "Hypernetwork" (as they call Cyberspace) to tenderize the hierarchical rigidity of both own organizations and Japanese society.

It was a little disorienting. Imagine an IBM vice-president with his fist thrust passionately in the air and you'll get the idea,

But it occurred to me that, if they are right, no organism with an immune system as subtle and robust as that of the larger, unindividuated Japanese whole is going to admit without response a virus which promises to attack its structural integrity. And not without cause. This is, after all, a society which is also largely free of such artifacts of individuality as random and violent crime. It is a society which works to the satisfaction of most of its constuents who might be expected to ask, "Why fix it? It ain't broke."

Perhaps if there were other persuasive reasons for Japan to jack into the Net, they might be willing to tolerate the deconstructive risks of networked computing. But why would people whose language is written, not typed, be eager to enter an environment where they would have to express themselves in the hard little alphanumerics of lower ascii? In fact, the recently developed Kanji keyboard does make it possible for the Japanese to input their data with something besides a calligraphy brush.

Why would a people who speak very little English be eager to enter a place where little else is spoken? Why would a people who have shown themselves to resistant to the global cultural blender of American culture eagerly enter a place as thoroughly American as Cyberspace is today?

Then there is the most fundamental question: why would a society so deeply interlaced with ancient and completely de-bugged human networks want a cranky new one of our design?

That there are no ready answers to these questions probably accounts for the scarcity, relative to population and technological sophistication, of Japanese Internet connections and a subdued market for high-speed data links in general. Unless one counts fax traffic, little of what passes through Japan's wires is digital. The best estimates I can get from several different sources indicate only about five to ten percent of Japan's 10 million personal computers are connected to a modem. Of these, about 200,000 are subscribers to NEC's PCvan. NiftyServe also has about 200,000 subscribers, but it's thought that many of these are the same people.

NEC is very committed to changing all this and one sees its billboards everywhere extolling "C&C", it's trademarked Romanji icon for computers and communications. Unfortunately, NEC's beliefs in the future of this market are not shared by the institution which must provide much of the infrastructure for that connection, the Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Company, the stately bureaucracy which does the phone in Japans.

When I spoke with Koichiro Hayashi, NTT's vice president of Leased Line Services (now head of NTT America), he told me there were only about 12,500 ISDN hook-ups in Japan (as of February of this year). When I asked him why this was, he said he couldn't imagine a general market for ISDN. His beliefs had a cultural basis.

"What about telecommuting?" I asked. Many of the office workers in Tokyo spend up to four hours every day in the middle of the most hellish commute imaginable. Wouldn't it be better if they could only come into the office a couple of days a week? "Japanese will never accept working in the home," he said.

He went on to point out that being part of the group is something which requires direct physical proximity with one's fellow workers. (There are neither individual offices nor even divided cubicles in Japanese white collar environments.) He didn't say so, but he also inferred that managers wouldn't accept a system where they couldn't watch their workers all the time.

He also that fewer than 5 percent of Japan's lines are digitally switched and thus ISDN ready, a figure which NTT feels no compelling justification for changing any time soon. Again, its reasons are cultural. NTT feels a sense of familial responsbility to the 70,000 telephone operators who jobs would be endangered by converson to digital switches. They claim there is neither a market now, nor on the horizon, which would justifiy laying off any of those operators.

This might change fairly soon. The same renegade managers who welcome networked computing labor in organizations which are busily trying to provide technological answers to the questions asked above. They are hard at work on their own pen-based interfaces and Kanji character-recognition systems. These will shortly make computers usable to the vast majority of Japanese who understandably find the Kanji keyboard an unacceptable kludge.

They have also embraced multmedia (or New Media, as the Newspeak commissars at Apple have now decreed it be called) and Virtual Reality with considerably greater enthusiasm than their American counterparts. As the cognitive bandwidth of Cyberspace fattens from text into video, sound and 3-D Garoud-rendered body puppets, we can expect to see a Japanese interest both in computing and digital communications which will reveal our current lead in these fields to be less a matter of our superiority than their disinterest.

At that point, we might might see some stiffening of our own cultural immune response systems.

More and more American commerce is in"soft" products... media, content, works of the mind. Whether actual software, digitized Hollywood films, the latest bestsellers, rock 'n' roll, dirty pictures, inside dope, you name it, if it can be turned into ones and zeros, it will be.

Once digitized, information is free to slip from the old physical "bottles"to which we have always attached our protective marks and into its natural home, Cyberspace. Online, it will be as hard to own or contain as air. Harder, in fact, since, unlike air, digitized data is infinitely reproducable and and malleable.

As things stand, practically the only protection which can be afforded soft products is the cultural willingness of people to pay for them. Contrast the American software market (where at least some percentage of the users feel ethically bound to pay for the stuff) with the market in Europe (where almost no one does) and you get some sense of how important conscience becomes when enforcement becomes impractical.

For all of their recent self-protective patent-filing, the ownership of ideas is as culturally alien to the Asian conceptial frame as the ownership of real estate was to the Sioux. It just doesn't seem to make sense to them. (Possibly because it may not make sense, but that's a topic for another column...)

Are we really going to want to share Cyberspace with cultures don't feel morally bound by our concepts of property, especially if those concepts are backed neither by workable laws, nor clearly defined jurisdictions to pass them. nor realistic means of enforcing anything which did get passed?

Then there is the matter of paying for Cyberspace itself. In the past, this wasn't a problem. There were only a couple of ways to ship a bit from here to there. You could use the phone system or the Internet.

The phone companies, public or private, owned the phones and that which connected. They knew what they had and how much it cost to keep it up. They knew how many users there were, how much they used it, and, with a little basic arithmetic and some horse trading with the Public Utilities Commission, how much to charge for carrying your data across the country.

The Internet was always a something of an anarchy, created and maintained from the bottom largely by volunteers with a little help from the Military Industrial Complex up top, but it was too small to cost much and too unimportant to raise many alarms as grew in complexity beyond anyone's mapping abilities.

More to the point, digtal communication tended to stay either within the confines of the a country or a company. Either way, it was pretty clear who set the fares, who paid them, and who was using what service.

These days, the Internet extends around the globe, and is too important to rely entirely on grad students and an underfunded arm of the American government, the National Science Foundation. Besides, there's a lot of money to be made.

Now, any entity which can propagate a signal is lining up to get rich in the info transport racket. The Net floats in an increasingly baffling web of heterogeneous connections: the suddenly bidirectonal coax of cable TV providers, optical fiber owned by railroad lines, microwaves bounced from surplus Soviet satellites, packets from amateur radios, the whole mess woven and tangled into an impossible spagetti of chaotic unaccountability.

When I finish this column and dispatch it from the Roppongi section of Tokyo to ACM headquarters on west 42nd Street, will consist of about a hundred thousand voltage shifts. No one will nor could know all the wires, waves, hard disks, central processors, earth stations, and light tubes will convey them there. No one will know who owns all these various media nor how to pay each of them a fair toll for this column's way.

Somehow, it all works, by grace and spit, but one wonders how long it can continue to do so before differences between such rigid, centralized organizational approaches as Japan's NTT will be culturally incompatible with the increasingly incomprehensible ecosystem of American telecommuncations.

Will it be possible for companies like Sprint or PSI to enter Japan to simply pull an end run around NTT and get provide high speed packet switched service? (I saw an advertisment for SprintLink in the Japan Times this morning.) Will other indigenous Japanese digital service providers arise? Will NTT suddenly recognize the economic potential of connected computing?

It all adds up to this: digitally connecting the two most most advanced technology bases in the world is not going to be an easy or straight-forward process. Getting Japan jacked into the Net in any useful sense may take years. Until they can overcome their cultural aversions to this evironment we may find America all hooked up with nowhere to go.

It's kind of like an updated version of the old Koan: what is the sound of one modem handshaking?

Bill O' Rights Lite

For the March, 1993

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

I do not fear Satan half so much as I fear those who fear him.

-Saint Theresa of Avila

It's now been almost three years since I first heard of the Secret Service raids on Steve Jackson Games and the cyberurchins from the Legion of Doom. These federal exploits, recently chronicled in Bruce Sterling's book Hacker Crackdown, precipitated the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and kicked loose an international digital liberties movement which is still growing by leaps and conferences.

I'm greatly encouraged by the heightened awareness among the citizens of the Global Net of our rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. I am also heartened that so many good minds now tug at the legal, ethical, and social riddles which come of digitizing every damned thing. The Social Contract of Cyberspace is being developed with astonishing rapidity, considering that we are all still deaf, dumb, and disembodied in here.

Meanwhile, back in the Physical World, I continue to be haunted by the words of the first lawyer I called on behalf of Steve Jackson, Phiber Optik, and Acid Phreak back in the Spring of 1990. This was Eric Lieberman of the prestigious New York civil liberties firm Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky, and Lieberman. I told him how the Secret Service had descended on my acquaintances and taken every scrap of circuitry or magnetized oxide they could find. This had included not only computers and disks, but clock radios and audio cassettes.

I told him that, because no charges had been filed, the government was providing their targets no legal opportunity to get recoup their confiscated equipment and data. (In fact, most of the victims of Operation Sun Devil still have neither been charged nor had their property returned to them.)

The searches were anything but surgical and the seizures appeared directed less at gathering evidence than inflicting punishment without the bothersome formality of a trial. I asked Lieberman if Secret Service might not be violating the 4th Amendment's assurance of "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."

He laughed bitterly. "I think if you take a look at case law for the last ten years or so, you will find that the 4th Amendment has pretty much gone away, " he said.

I did. He was right. A lot of what remained of it was flushed a year later when the Rehnquist Court declared that in the presence of "probable cause"...a phrase of inviting open-ness...law enforcement officials could search first and obtain warrants later.

Furthermore, I learned that through such sweeping prosecutorial enablements as RICO and Zero Tolerance, the authorities could enact their own unadjudicated administrative "fines" by keeping much of what they seized for their own uses.

(This incentive often leads to disproportionalities between "punishment"and "crime" which even ol' Kafka might have found a bit over the top. I know of one case in which the DEA acquired a $14 million dollar Gulfstream b izjet from a charter operator because one of its clients left half a gram of cocaine in its washroom.)

I tried to imagine a kind of interactive Bill of Rights in which Amendments would fade to invisibility as they became meaningless, but I knew that was hardly necessary. The citizens of Stalin's Soviet Union had a constitutional guarantee of free expression which obviously, like our own, allowed some room for judicial interpretation.

It occurred to me then that a more honest approach might be to maintain a concordant Bill of Rights, running in real time and providing up to the minute weather reports from the Federal Bench, but I never got around to it.

Recently I started thinking about it again. These thoughts were inspired partly by Dorothy Denning's apology for the FBI's Digital Telephony proposal (which appears elsewhere in this issue). I found her analysis surprisingly persuasive, but I also found it fundamentally based on an assumption I no longer share: the ability of the Bill of Rights to restrain government, now or in the future.

The men who drafted the United States Constitution and its first ten amendments knew something which we have largely forgotten: Governments exist to limit freedom. That's their job. And to the extent that utterly unbridled liberty seems to favor the reptile in us, a little government is not such a bad thing. But it never knows when to quit. As there is no limit to either human imagination or creativity in the wicked service of the Self, so it is always easy for our official protectors to envision new atrocities to prevent.

Knowing this, James Madison and company designed a government which was slightly broken up front. They intentionally created a few wrenches to cast into the works, and these impediments to smooth governmental operation were the Bill of Rights.

Lately though, we find ourselves living in a world where the dangers we perceive are creatures of information rather than experience. Since the devil one knows is always less fearsome than the worst one can imagine, there is no limit to how terrifying or potent these dangers can seem.

Very few of us, if any, have ever felt the malign presence of a real, live terrorist or drug lord or Mafia capo or dark side hacker or kiddy pornographer. They are projected into our consciousness by the media and the government, both of which profit directly from our fear of them. These enemies are, in our (tele)visions of them, entirely lacking in human decency or conscience. There is no reason they should be mollycoddled with constitutional rights.

And so, we have become increasingly willing to extend to government what the founding fathers would not: real efficiency. The courts, heartily encouraged by the older white suburbanites who still vote, have been updating the Bill of Rights to fit modern times and perils, without anyone's having to go through the cumbersome procedure of formal amendment.

The result, I would suggest with only a little sarcasm or hyperbole, has come to look something like this:

Bill o' Rights Lite

Amendment 1

Congress shall encourage the practice of Judeo-Christian religion by its own public exercise thereof and shall make no laws abridging the freedom of responsible speech, unless such speech is in a digitized form or contains material which is copyrighted, classified, proprietary, or deeply offensive to non-Europeans, non-males, differently-abled or alternatively preferenced persons; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, unless such assembly is taking place on corporate or military property or within an electronic environment, or to make petitions to the Government for a redress of grievances, unless those grievances relate to national security.

Amendment 2

A well-regulated Militia having become irrelevant to the security of the State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms against one another shall nevertheless remain uninfringed, excepting such arms as may be afforded by the poor or those preferred by drug pushers, terrorists, and organized criminals, which shall be banned.

Amendment 3

No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, unless that house is thought to have been used for the distribution of illegal substances.

Amendment 4

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers. and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, may be suspended to protect public welfare, and upon the unsupported suspicion of law enforcement officials, any place or conveyance shall be subject to immediate search, and any such places or conveyances or property within them may be permanently confiscated without further judicial proceeding.

Amendment 5

Any person may be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime involving illicit substances, terrorism, or child pornography, or upon any suspicion whatever; and may be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb, once by the State courts and again by the Federal Judiciary; and may be compelled by various means, including the forced submission of breath samples, bodily fluids, or encryption keys, to be a witness against himself, refusal to do so constituting an admission of guilt; and may be deprived of life, liberty, or property without further legal delay; and any property thereby forfeited shall be dedicated to the discretionary use of law enforcement agents.

Amendment 6

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and private plea bargaining session before pleading guilty.

A Plain Text on Crypto Policy

For the October, 1993 Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

The field of cryptography, for centuries accustomed to hermetic isolation within a culture as obscure as its own puzzles, is going public. People who thought algorithms were maybe something you needed to dig rap music are suddenly taking an active interest in the black arts of crypto.

We have the FBI and NSA to thank for this. The FBI was first to arouse public concerns about the future of digital privacy with its injection of language year before last into a major Senate anti-crime bill (SB 266) which would have registered the congressional intent that all providers of digitized communications should provide law enforcement with analog access to voice and data transmissions of their subscribers.

When this was quietly yanked in committee, they returned with a proposed bill called Digital Telephony. If passed, it would have essentially called a halt to most American progress in telecommunications until they could be assured of their continued ability to wiretap. Strange but true.

They were never able to find anyone in Congress technologically backward enough to introduce this oddity for them, but they did elevate public awareness of the issues considerably.

The National Security Agency, for all its (unknown but huge) budget, staff, and MIPS, has about as much real world political experience as the Order of Trappists and has demonstrated in its management of cryptology export policies the maddening counter-productivity that is the usual companion of inexperience.

The joint bunglings of these two agencies were starting to infuriate a lot of people and institutions who are rarely troubled by Large Governmental Foolishness in the Service of Paranoia. Along with all the usual paranoids, of course.

Then from the NSA's caverns in Fort Meade, Maryland there slouched a chip called Clipper.

For those of you who just tuned in (or who tuned out early), the Clipper Chip...now called Skipjack owing to a trademark conflict...is a hardware encryption device that NSA designed under Reagan-Bush. In April it was unveiled by the Clinton Administration and proposed for both governmental and public use. Installed in phones or other telecommunications tools, it would turn any conversation into gibberish for all but the speaker and his intended listener, using a secret military algorithm.

Clipper/Skipjack is unique, and controversial, in that it also allows the agents of government to listen under certain circumstances. Each chip contains a key that is split into two parts immediately following manufacture. Each half is then placed in the custody of some trusted institution or "escrow agent."

If, at some subsequent time, some government agency desires to legally listen in on the owner of the communications device in which the chip has been placed, it would present evidence of "lawful authority" to the escrow holders. They will reveal the key pairs, the agency will join them, and begin listening to the subject's unencrypted conversations.

(Apparently there are other agencies besides law enforcement who can legally listen to electronic communications. The government has evaded questions about exactly who will have access to these keys, or for that matter, what, besides an judicial warrant, constitutes the "lawful authority" to which they continually refer.)

Clipper/Skipjack was not well received. The blizzard of anguished ASCII it summoned forth on the Net has been so endlessly voluble and so painstaking in its "How-many-Cray-Years-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-Clipper-Chip"technical detail that I would guess all but the real cypherpunks are by now data-shocked into listlessness and confusion.

Indeed, I suspect that even many readers of this publication...a group with prodigious capacity for assimilating the arid and obscure...are starting to long for the days when their knowledge of cryptography and the public policies surrounding it was limited enough to be coherent.

So I almost hesitate to bring the subject up. Yet somewhere amid this racket, decisions are being made that will profoundly affect your future ability to communicate without fear. Those who would sacrifice your liberty for their illusions of public safety are being afforded some refuge by the very din of opposition.

In the hope of restoring both light and heat to the debate, I'm going to summarize previous episodes, state a few conclusions I've drawn about the current techno-political terrain, and recommend positions you might consider taking, as well as actions that might support them.

Clipper/Skipjack Really Is A Dumb Idea.

When I first heard about Clipper/Skipjack, I thought it might not be such a bad idea. This false conclusion was partly due to the reality distorting character of the location...I was about fifty feet away from the Oval Office at the time...but it also seemed like one plausible approach to what may be the bright future of crime in the Virtual Age.

I mean, I can see what the Guardian Class is worried about. The greater part of business is already being transacted in Cyberspace. Most of the money is there. At the moment, however, most of the monetary bits in there are being accounted for. Accounting is digital, but cash is not.

It is imaginable that, with the widespread use of digital cash and encrypted monetary exchange on the Global Net, economies the size of America's could appear as nothing but oceans of alphabet soup. Money laundering would no longer be necessary. The payment of taxes might become more or less voluntary. A lot of weird things would happen after that...

I'm pretty comfortable with chaos, but this is not a future I greet without reservation.

So, while I'm not entirely persuaded that we need to give up our future privacy to protect ourselves from drug dealers, terrorists, child molesters, and un-named military opponents (the Four Horsemen of Fear customarily invoked by our protectors), I can imagine bogeymen whose traffic I'd want visible to authority.

Trouble is, the more one learns about Clipper/Skipjack, the less persuaded he is that it would do much to bring many actual Bad Guys under scrutiny.

As proposed, it would be a voluntary standard, spread mainly by the market forces that would arise after the government bought a few tons of these chips for their own "sensitive but unclassified" communications systems. No one would be driven to use it by anything but convenience. In fact, no one with any brains would use it if he were trying to get away with anything.

In fact, the man who claims to have designed Clipper's basic specs, Acting NIST Director Ray Kammer, recently said, "It's obvious that anyone who uses Clipper for the conduct of organized crime is dumb." No kidding. At least so long as it's voluntary.

Under sober review, there mounted an incredibly long list of reasons to think Clipper/Skipjack might not be a fully-baked idea. In May, after a month of study, the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a coalition of some 40 companies and organizations chaired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent the White House 118 extremely tough questions regarding Clipper, any five of which should have been sufficient to put the kibosh on it.

The members of this group were not a bunch of hysterics. It includes DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sun, MCI, Microsoft, Apple, and AT&T (which was also, interestingly enough, the first company to commit to putting Clipper/Skipjack in its own products).

Among the more troubling of their questions:

\\* Who would the escrow agents be?

\\* What are Clipper's likely economic impacts, especially in regard to export of American digital products?

\\* Why is its encryption algorithm secret and why should the public have confidence in a government-derived algorithm that can't be privately tested?

\\* Why is Clipper/Skipjack being ram-rodded into adoption as a government standard before completion of an over-all review of U.S. policies on cryptography?

\\* Why are the NSA, FBI, and NIST stone-walling Freedom of Information inquiries about Clipper/Skipjack? (In fact, NSA's response has been, essentially, "So? Sue us.")

\\* Assuming Clipper/Skipjack becomes a standard, what happens if the escrow depositories are compromised?

\\* Wouldn't these depositories also become targets of opportunity for any criminal or terrorist organization that wanted to disrupt US. law enforcement?

\\* Since the chip transmits its serial number at the beginning of each connection, why wouldn't it render its owner's activities highly visible through traffic analysis (for which government needs no warrant)?

\\* Why would a foreign customer buy a device that exposed his conversations to examination by the government of the United States?

\\* Does the deployment and use of the chip possibly violate the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution?

\\* In its discussions of Clipper/Skipjack, the government often uses the phrase "lawfully authorized electronic surveillance." What, exactly, do they mean by this?

\\* Is it appropriate to insert classified technology into either the public communications network or into the general suite of public technology standards?

And so on and so forth. As I say, it was a very long list. On July 29, John D. Podesta, Assistant to the President and White House Staff Secretary (and, interestingly enough, a former legal consultant to EFF and Co-Chair of the Digital Privacy Working Group), responded to these questions. He actually answered few of them.

Still un-named, undescribed, and increasingly unimaginable were the escrow agents. Questions about the inviolability of the depositories were met with something like, "Don't worry, they'll be secure. Trust us."

There seemed a lot of that in Podesta's responses. While the government had convened a panel of learned cryptologists to examine the classified Skipjack algorithm, it had failed to inspire much confidence among the crypto establishment, most of whom were still disinclined to trust anything they couldn't whack at themselves. At the least, most people felt a proper examination would take longer than the month or so the panel got. After all, it took fifteen years to find a hairline fissure in DES .

But neither Podesta nor any other official explained why it had seemed necessary to use a classified military algorithm for civilian purposes. Nor were the potential economic impacts addressed. Nor were the concerns about traffic analysis laid to rest.

But as Thomas Pynchon once wrote, "If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers." Neither asked nor answered in all of this was the one question that kept coming back to me: Was this trip really necessary?

For all the debate over the details, few on either side seemed to be approaching the matter from first principles. Were the enshrined threats...drug dealers, terrorists, child molesters, and foreign enemies...sufficiently and presently imperiling to justify fundamentally compromising all future transmitted privacy?

I mean...speaking personally now...it seems to me that America's greatest health risks derive from the drugs that are legal, a position the statistics overwhelmingly support. And then there's terrorism, to which we lost a total of two Americans in 1992, even with the World Trade Center bombing, only 6 in 1993. I honestly can't imagine an organized ring of child molesters, but I suppose one or two might be out there. And the last time we got into a shooting match with another nation, we beat them by a kill ratio of about 2300 to 1.

Even if these are real threats, was enhanced wire-tap the best way to combat them? Apparently, it hasn't been in the past. Over the last ten years the average total nation-wide number of admissible state and federal wire-taps has numbered less than 800. Wire-tap is not at present a major enforcement tool, and is far less efficient than the informants, witnesses, physical evidence, and good old fashioned detective work they usually rely on.

(It's worth noting that the World Trade Center bombing case unraveled, not through wire-taps, but with the discovery of the axle serial number on the van which held the explosives.)

Despite all these questions, both unasked and unanswered, Clipper continues (at the time of this writing) to sail briskly toward standardhood, the full wind of government bearing her along.

On July 30, NIST issued a request for public comments on its proposal to establish Clipper/Skipjack as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). All comments are due by September 28, and the government seems unwilling to delay the process despite the lack of an overall guiding policy on crypto. Worse, they are putting a hard sell on Clipper/Skipjack without a clue as to who might be escrow holders upon whose political acceptability the entire scheme hinges.

Nor have they addressed the central question: why would a criminal use a key escrow device unless he were either very stupid...in which case he'd be easily caught anyway...or simply had no choice.

All this leads me to an uncharacteristically paranoid conclusion:

The Government May Mandate Key Escrow Encryption and Outlaw Other Forms.

It is increasingly hard for me to imagine any other purpose for the Clipper/Skipjack operetta if not to prepare the way for the restriction of all private cryptographic uses to a key escrow system. If I were going to move the American people into a condition where they might accept restrictions on their encryption, I would first engineer the wide-spread deployment of a key escrow system on a voluntary basis, wait for some blind sheik to slip a bomb plot around it and then say, "Sorry, folks this ain't enough, it's got to be universal."

Otherwise, why bother? Even its most ardent proponents admit that no intelligent criminal would trust his communications to a key escrow device. On the other hand, if nearly all encrypted traffic were Skipjack-flavored, any transmission encoded by some other algorithm would stick out like a licorice Dot.

In fact, the assumption that Cyberspace will roar one day with Skipjack babble lies behind the stated reason for the secrecy for the algorithm. In their Interim Report, the Skipjack review panel puts it this way:

Disclosure of the algorithm would permit the construction of devices that fail to properly implement the LEAF \[or Law Enforcement Access Field\], while still interoperating with legitimate SKIPJACK devices. Such devices would provide high quality cryptographic security without preserving the law enforcement access capability that distinguishes this cryptographic initiative.

In other words, they don't want devices or software out there that might use the Skipjack algorithm without depositing a key with the escrow holders. (By the way, this claim is open to question. Publishing Skipjack would not necessarily endow anyone with the ability to build an interoperable chip.)

Then there was the conversation I had with a highly-placed official of the National Security Council in which he mused that the French had, after all, outlawed the private use of cryptography, so it weren't as though it couldn't be done. (He didn't suggest that we should also emulate France's policy of conducting espionage on other countries' industries, though wide-spread international use of Clipper/Skipjack would certainly enhance our ability to do so.)

Be that as it may, France doesn't have a Bill of Rights to violate, which it seems to me that restriction of cryptography in America would do on several counts.

Mandated encryption standards would fly against the First Amendment, which surely protects the manner of our speech as clearly as it protects the content. Whole languages (most of them patois) have arisen on this planet for the purpose of making the speaker unintelligible to authority. I know of no instance where, even in the oppressive colonies where such languages were formed, that the slave-owners banned their use.

Furthermore, the encryption software itself is written expression, upon which no ban may be constitutionally imposed. (What, you might ask then, about the constitutionality of restrictions on algorithm export. I'd say they're being allowed only because no one ever got around to testing from that angle.)

The First Amendment also protects freedom of association. On several different occasions, most notably NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson and Talley vs. California, the courts have ruled that requiring the disclosure of either an organization's membership or the identity of an individual could lead to reprisals, thereby suppressing both association and speech. Certainly in a place like Cyberspace where everyone is so generally "visible," no truly private "assembly" can take place without some technical means of hiding the participants.

It also looks to me as if the forced imposition of a key escrow system might violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.

The Fourth Amendment prohibits secret searches. Even with a warrant, agents of the government must announce themselves before entering and may not seize property without informing the owner. Wire-taps inhabit a gray-ish area of the law in that they permit the secret "seizure" of an actual conversation by those actively eavesdropping on it. The law does not permit the subsequent secret seizure of a record of that conversation. Given the nature of electronic communications, an encryption key opens not only the phone line but the filing cabinet.

Finally, the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to reveal self-incriminating evidence. While no court has ever ruled on the matter vis a vis encryption keys, there seems something involuntarily self-incriminating about being forced to give up your secrets in advance. Which is, essentially, what mandatory key escrow would require you to do.

For all these protections, I keep thinking it would be nice to have a constitution like the one just adopted by our largest possible enemy, Russia. As I understand it, this document explicitly forbids governmental restrictions on the use of cryptography.

For the moment, we have to take our comfort in the fact that our government...or at least the parts of it that state their intentions...avows both publicly and privately that it has no intention to impose key escrow cryptography as a mandatory standard. It would be, to use Podesta's mild word, "imprudent."

But it's not Podesta or anyone else in the current White House who worries me. Despite their claims to the contrary, I'm not convinced they like Clipper any better than I do. In fact, one of them...not Podesta...called Clipper "our Bay of Pigs," referring to the ill-fated Cuban invasion cooked up by the CIA under Eisenhower and executed (badly) by a reluctant Kennedy Administration. The comparison may not be invidious.

It's the people I can't see who worry me. These are the people who actually developed Clipper/Skipjack and its classified algorithm, the people who, through export controls, have kept American cryptography largely to themselves, the people who are establishing in secret what the public can or cannot employ to protect its own secrets. They are invisible and silent to all the citizens they purportedly serve save those who sit the Congressional intelligence committees.

In secret, they are making for us what may be the most important choice that has ever faced American democracy, that is, whether our descendants will lead their private lives with unprecedented mobility and safety from coercion, or whether every move they make, geographic, economic, or amorous, will be visible to anyone who possesses whatever may then constitute "lawful authority."

Who Are the Lawful Authorities?

Over a year ago, when I first fell down the rabbit hole into Cryptoland, I wrote a Communications column called Decrypting the Puzzle Palace. In it, I advanced what I then thought a slightly paranoid thesis, suggesting that the NSA-guided embargoes on robust encryption software had been driven not by their stated justification (keeping good cryptography out of the possession of foreign military adversaries) but rather restricting its use by domestic civilians.

In the course of writing that piece, I spoke to a number of officials, including former CIA Director Stansfield Turner and former NSA Director Bobby Ray Inman, who assured me that using a military organization to shape domestic policy would be "injudicious" (as Turner put it), but no one could think of any law or regulation that might specifically prohibit the NSA from serving the goals of the Department of Justice.

But since then I've learned a lot about the hazy Post-Reagan/Bush lines between law enforcement and intelligence. They started redrawing the map of authority early in their administration with Executive Order 12333, issued on December 4, 1981. (Federal Register #: 46 FR 59941)

This sweeping decree defines the duties and limitations of the various intelligence organizations of the United States and contains the following language:

1.4 The Intelligence Community. The agencies within the Intelligence Community shall...conduct intelligence activities necessary for the... protection of the national security of the United States, including: ... (c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of activities to protect against, intelligence activities directed against the United States, international terrorist and international narcotics activities, and other hostile activities directed against the United States by foreign powers, organizations, persons, and their agents; (Italics Added)

Further, in Section 2.6, Assistance to Law Enforcement Authorities, agencies within the Intelligence Community are

authorized to...participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers, or international terrorist or narcotics activities.

In other words, the intelligence community was specifically charged with investigative responsibility for international criminal activities in the areas of drugs and terrorism.

Furthermore, within certain fairly loose guidelines, intelligence organizations are "authorized to collect, retain or disseminate information concerning United States persons" that may include "incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local or foreign laws."

Given that the NSA monitors a significant portion of all the electronic communications between the United States and other countries, the opportunities for "incidentally obtaining" information that might incriminate Americans inside America are great.

Furthermore, over the course of the Reagan/Bush administration, the job of fighting the War on Some Drugs gradually spread to every element of the Executive Branch.

Even the Department of Energy is now involved. At an Intelligence Community conference last winter I heard a proud speech from a DOE official in which he talked about how some of the bomb-designing supercomputers at Los Alamos had been turned to the peaceful purpose of sifting through huge piles of openly available data...newspapers, courthouse records, etc....in search of patterns that would expose drug users and traffickers. They are selling their results to a variety of "lawful authorities," ranging from the Southern Command of the U.S. Army to the Panamanian Defense Forces to various County Sheriff's Departments.

"Fine," you might say, "Drug use is a epidemic that merits any cure." But I would be surprised if there's anyone who will read this sentence who has broken no laws whatever. And it's anybody's guess what evidence of other unlawful activities might be "incidentally obtained" by such a wide net as DOE is flinging.

The central focus that drugs and terrorism have assumed within the intelligence agencies was underscored for me by a recent tour of the central operations room at the CIA. There, in the nerve center of American intelligence, were desks for Asia, Europe, North America, Africa and "Middle East/Terrorism," and "South America/Narcotics." These bogeymen are now the size of continents on the governmental map of peril.

Given this perception of its duties, the NSA's strict opposition to the export of strong cryptographic engines, hard or soft, starts to make more sense. They are not, as I'd feared, so clue-impaired as to think their embargoes are denying any other nation access to good cryptography. (According to an internal Department of Defense analysis of crypto policy, it recently took 3 minutes and 14 seconds to locate a source code version of DES on the Internet.)

Nor do they really believe these policies are enhancing national security in the traditional, military sense of the word, where the U.S. is, in any case, already absurdly over-matched to any national adversary, as was proven during the Gulf War.

It's the enemies they can't bomb who have them worried, and they are certainly correct in thinking that the communications of drug traffickers and whatever few terrorists as may actually exist are more open to their perusal than would be the case in a world where even your grandmother's phone conversations were encrypted.

And Clipper or no Clipper, such a world would be closer at hand if manufacturers hadn't known than any device that embodies good encryption would not be fit for export.

But with Clipper/Skipjack, there is a lot that the combined forces of government will be able to do to monitor all aspects of your behavior without getting a warrant. Between the monitoring capacities of the NSA, the great data-sieves of the Department of Energy, and the fact that, in use, each chip would continually broadcast the whereabouts of its owner, the government would soon be able to isolate just about every perpetrator among us.

I assume you're neither a drug-user nor a terrorist, but are you ready for this? Is your nose that clean? Can it be prudent to give the government this kind of corrupting power?

I don't think so, but this is what will happen if we continue to allow the secret elements of government to shape domestic policy as though the only American goals that mattered were stopping terrorism (which seems pretty well stopped already) and winning the War on Some Drugs (which no amount of force will ever completely win).

Unfortunately, we are not able to discuss priorities with the people who are setting them, nor do they seem particularly amenable to any form of authority. In a recent discussion with a White House official, I asked for his help in getting the NSA to come out of its bunker and engage in direct and open discussions about crypto embargoes, key escrow, the Skipjack algorithm, and the other matters of public interest.

"I'll see what we can do," he said.

"But you guys are the government," I protested. "Surely they'll do as you tell them."

"I'll see what we can do," he repeated, offering little optimism.

That was months ago. In the meantime, the NSA has not only remained utterly unforthcoming in public discussions of crypto policy, they have unlawfully refused to comply with any Freedom of Information Act requests for documents in this area.

It is time for the public to reassert control over their own government. It is time to demand that public policy be made in public by officials with names, faces, and personal accountability.

When and if we are able to actually discuss crypto policy with the people who are setting it, I have a list of objectives that I hope many of you will share. There are as follows:

A Policy on Cryptography

1\. There should no law restricting any use of cryptography by private citizens.

2\. There should be no restriction on the export of cryptographic algorithms or any other instruments of cryptography.

3\. Secret agencies should not be allowed to drive public policies.

4\. The taxpayer's investment in encryption technology and related mathematical research should be made available for public and scientific use. 5. The government should encourage the deployment of wide-spread encryption.

6\. While key escrow systems may have purposes, none should be implemented that places the keys in the hands of government.

7\. Any encryption standard to be implemented by the government should developed in an open and public fashion and should not employ a secret algorithm.

And last, or perhaps, first...

8\. There should be no broadening of governmental access to private communications and records unless there is a public consensus that the risks to safety outweigh the risks to liberty and will be effectively addressed by these means.

If you support these principles, or even if you don't, I hope you will participate in making this a public process. And there are a number of actions you can take in that regard.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a request for public comments on its proposal to establish the "Skipjack"key-escrow system as a Federal Information Processing Standard. You've got until September 28 to tell them what you think of that. Comments on the NIST proposal should be sent to:

Director, Computer Systems Laboratory ATTN: Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption Standard Technology Building, Room B-154 National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg, MD 20899

If you belong to or work for an organization, you can encourage that organization to join the Digital Privacy Working Group. To do so they should contact EFF's Washington office at:

Dad's Invisible Guard-All Shield

For the April, 1993

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. --Jeremiah 31:29

Some years back, when I was still a Wyoming environmentalist, I found myself crossing South Pass with an old sheep rancher I knew. We were going to a federal hearing in Casper where, as an ideologically committed resource rapist, he would be my principal opponent. I can't remember the issue at contest. Probably strip-mine reclamation or something. That memory is blurred by the more vivid recollection of sun dogs through the tinted windows of his Olds Tornado and something he said to me that winter afternoon.

Our opinions had few intersections, but we liked each other. Our opposition was cultural, not personal. He had his sense of Nature and what one might responsibly do to Her. I had mine. We'd been arguing for about an hour, getting nowhere near any joint accommodation, when old Leonard leaned back and said, "Well, John Perry, look at it this way. Someday I'll be dead and you won't."

By this he meant that a time would come when world management would be up to me and others of my generation. Then it would be ours to mess up as we saw fit. Of course, he was also saying that we should wait patiently while his generation continued to mess it up as they saw fit. But still, he had a point.

Over the last year I've frequently found myself close to the places from which the world really does get managed, to whatever little degree it doesn't somehow manage itself. As Leonard predicted, the good old boys are now mostly either dead or terminally golfing. For the first time in my life, the President is a contemporary.

During its first year, Bill 'n' Al's Excellent Adventure seemed proof that, however unwillingly, the previous generation had finally relaxed their defining grip on the dominant American Reality. It looked like the stiff-lipped, big-fisted, team-playing, can-do geopolitical style to which they adapted while coming of age in World War II might finally be ready for History's Yard Sale.

But now I begin to wonder if they haven't out-foxed us after all. Like Pharaohs booby-trapping the Pyramids, they have left behind great institutional automata which will keep much of government dancing to Sinatra (and all the cultural perceptions and values he embodies) until the Dead finally are. They are reaching out from the grave (or some back nine at Palm Desert) and defining the New World Order around the same old paranoid paradigm.

The Sixties were a scary time for everyone. I, for one, fully intended to bring about The End of Civilization as We Knew It. Of course, the guardians of that Civilization responded accordingly. First, they disinherited the lot of us. Then they remained in office themselves much longer than is usually the custom any place but Beijing or Salt Lake City. Then whenever possible, they passed the torch over to our younger siblings who, being more generally comfortable in a nice blue serge, were less likely to conduct government by apocalypse.

Given what was going down at the time, I could hardly blame the old guys for their reaction to us. And, in retrospect, I am even forced to admit that a few of their policies, most notably Mutually Assured Destruction, were not as mad as they seemed to me then. After all, there hasn't been a global bloodbath since the one they fought in. It may well be that such vile psychic weather as used to blow up every generation was prevented by their tight forty year focus on assuring the Soviets that attacking us was tantamount to committing national suicide.

But maintaining that threat also meant keeping my peacenik kind away from the hideous machines which would carry it out, so they protected them behind billowing ink-clouds of secrecy and semi-permeable political membranes called security clearances.

The latter included, as a prerequisite to serious government service, being asked the following questions (from National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) DD Form 398-2):

Question 20: Drug/Alcohol Use and Mental Health ("YES" answers must be explained in accordance with DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS)

a. Have you ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include heroin or cocaine), depressant, (to include quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen, (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or hashish), or any mind-altering substance (to include glue or paint), even one time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed physician.

b. Have you ever been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis?

c. Have you ever misused or abused any drug prescribed by a licensed physician for yourself or someone else?

d.

e. Have you ever been treated for a mental, emotional, psychological, or personality disorder/condition/problem?

The "DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS" say:

If "Yes" is answered to any of the questions in this item, describe the circumstance in item 14, in accordance with the following explanations. If necessary, attach additional sheets for a full detailed statement.

a. Drug Use/Possession. A listing of those drugs which have been designated as controlled substances is located on the last page of these instructions. If you used any of these drugs, or any other mind-altering substances, mark "Yes", and provide in Item 14, the following details:

\\* Drug(s) used/possessed \* Date(s) of use/possession \* Frequency of use/possession \* Intentions regarding future use/possession \* City and state (or country if not in U.D.) where used/possessed \* Circumstances surrounding use/possession

IF MORE THAN ONE DRUG HAS BEEN USED/POSSESSED, PROVIDE THE Information ABOVE FOR EACH DRUG SEPARATELY

b. Drug Activity. The drugs referred to are again those listed on the attachment or any other mind-altering substances. If "Yes", you must indicate on the NAQ the activity (or activities) in which you were involved by circling "purchase", "manufacture", "trafficking", "production", or "sale" and provide in Item 14 the following details:

\\* drugs involved \* Dates(s) of activity \* Number of times you participated in activity \* Current activity \* Intentions regarding future activity \* City and state (or country if not in U.S.) where activity took place \* Circumstances surrounding activity

AGAIN, IF MORE THAN ONE DRUG IS INVOLVED, PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR EACH DRUG SEPARATELY.

Now I'm probably a special case, but I don't have very many friends or colleagues who could remember detailed answers to such a quiz, let alone find time to answer them in the required detail. Then of course there's the matter the matter of self-incrimination. Or the fact that either way, you don't get the job.

Even if you were perfectly straight with regard to other drugs besides the legal ones, getting a security clearance requires that neither you nor your friends are made uncomfortable by having FBI agents inquiring into the finer shades of your sexual settings (and, sex being what it is, almost everyone has some minor oddity in the closet), your political associations, your personal associations, or any of the other details of a life which might deviate from their own pious path.

A security clearance is, in other words, a cultural filter which is designed to assure that the higher reaches of government will be staffed by the conventional, the dutiful (generally younger or older than me), the strangely old paradigm Dan Quayle types nobody wanted to hang out with in college, or those of us who are willing to swear under oath that we never did any of the things that most of my generation did several times a week. (And that, in many cases, they still do.)

In fact, it assures that America will be run by people who are temperamentally quite different from the people they serve, unless you think that most Americans are like FBI agents and career military officers. (I think it's safe to say that a majority of the members of Association of Computing Machinery would have a hard time making it through this invisible Guard-All shield.) It certainly assures that it will be run by people who have roughly the same values, perceptions, view of the world...the same culture...which our fathers had. (Note that I do not say "mothers.")

Thanks to this engine of cultural self-propagation, the official culture of American government is straight from the Fifties. In the view of most of those now gathered around the misty summits of power, the Sixties were a period in which you either didn't participate or only did so by some mistake of which you are now soundly repentant. They were an experiment that failed. There was nothing to be learned from them. No consciousness was altered for the better.

Indeed, consciousness is not a word they use there much, and certainly not in reference to anything more than the difference between waking and sleeping. In short, not much has changed in a very long time. Nor is it likely to in a environment in which the prevailing sentiment is that all change is for the worse.

Elsewhere, of course, things have changed, rather fundamentally and in many ways that arise directly from the lessons, insights, technologies, and paradigm shifts cut loose by the Sixties.

Elsewhere, the Cold War is over and America has other jobs besides preserving its borders against hostile attack. Indeed, all the political, cultural, and geographical boundaries over which humans glowered at one another from World War II until a few years ago seem barely functional constructs in the instantaneous reality most of us now inhabit.

The very idea which is so central to those who can get security clearances...the primacy of national security...bases itself on the premise that there is a clearly defined Nation to secure, that national borders are still meaningful, that there is something like an American consensus.

Exactly what is the United States of America these days? I recently asked a couple of Clinton/Gore staffers this question. What, I wanted to know, did they regard it their duty to protect?

Whatever pays taxes to Washington? Whatever lies within our traditional geographical boundaries? Whomever speaks English with an American accent, believes in Jesus and free markets, and beams his global reality from CNN above?

They looked at me funny, of course. "That's not the kind of question we ask around the White House," one of them said, dismissing me for some kind of precious Post-Modernist ninny. They didn't ask questions like that because, as my father (or old Leonard) would have said, it just isn't practical.

However similar these fellows were to me in their age, education, intelligence, and general commitment to the human commonweal, they were on the other side of that cultural barricade, our fathers' side. They had security clearances. They had passed through a filter which vouchsafed their adherence to a paradigm which hasn't been mine since that fine day back in 1967 when I dropped acid for the first time, eliminating my shot of ever simultaneously being both an honest man and a high government official

I also eliminated on that day my sense that reality was a fact and not an opinion. But for these fellows, there were no new realities to accommodate because, as our fathers knew before us, reality is not something which might be mutable. Reality just is. As it always has been. World without end. That it might now be impractical not to ask such questions, or that failure to do so might be a form of institutionalized denial, has not apparently occurred to many in this or any other government in my lifetime.

The purpose of the foregoing rant is not quite as self-serving as it might appear. I'm not simply another old hippie belly-aching about his shattered dreams, though I'm certainly vulnerable to the charge. Nor am I whining over being excluded from government, nor even bragging that my mind is too expanded to fit through the artificially narrowed portals of power. It's also expanded enough to know that power is itself a largely delusory condition from which I am well enough pleased to be excluded.

Rather, I'm trying to give you a context in which to understand a number of government actions and policies which baffled me until I understood who was promulgating them, how their directors looked at the world, and why that particular world view, quaint though it is, still seems to be in the promulgative driver's seat.

Readers of this column will hardly be surprised at the policies which snap most readily to my mind. They're things like:

\\* Export embargoes on encryption products and indeed, on knowledge about encryption despite the incredible porosity of the environment where such things exist.

\\* Digital Telephony and its underlying assumption that the ability to conduct surveillance on American citizens is more important than progress in our most economically promising technology: telecommunications.

\\* The Clipper Chip. Of course.

\\* Information infrastructure policies which seem to assume that there is a national Net which is somehow sublimely abstracted from the international Net.

\\* The belief that that this spreading digital neurology really is like the Interstate Highway System with all the imposed Fifties-style centralization of design, funding, and, most of all, susceptibility to control inherent in such an architecture.

\\* And, of course, continuing astronomical expenditures on "national security" at a time when when the greatest collective threat we face is the deficit that these outlays are ramming deeper into the red.

What these policies have in common is an underlying assumption that we still live on the crisply divided planet of our father's experience, a world where the Us/Them dichotomy is not open to conjecture and where They are so depraved and well-armed that few measures are too extreme to ensure our safety from them.

Those of who live in the world as it has become, and particularly those of us who live on the Net, may find it hard to believe that there enough Old Paradigm types left to staff the power end of the Executive Branch. But, as I say, the security clearance filter has managed to catch the few that are available.

In addition, the more evolved people who did somehow make the cut (usually by some lawyerly gavotte around certain questions) are soon subsumed into the mind-field on the other side of the security membrane. In a fairly short time, they drink that Kool-Aid and the result is straight out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

I got a close-up look at this phenomenon recently while trying, with pitiful futility, to convince various White House officials of the folly of their freshly hardened positions on crypto. Though I knew that some of these folks had once been rather like me...indeed, I had known them when they were...they now seemed, well, different.

They were transfixed by the vision of the nuclear-armed terrorist, and they were ready to do just about anything, no matter how ridiculous, if it could seen as an honest effort to stop this heretofore unexperienced disaster. Within the strait confines of the national security logic, they were prepared dedicate the same level of wartime energy (and expediency regarding civil liberties) to protecting against nuclear horror that our fathers had when the other side had missiles rather than Ryder trucks to deliver its warheads.

Every time I thought I had them logically backed into some particularly goofy aspect of the Clipper "solution" to this threat, they would zip down the tautological rabbit hole of: "If you knew what we know and can't tell you, you'd feel the same way we do."

Where had I heard that phrase before? It was all-purpose "reason" behind which my father's generation pursued everything from the massive manufacture of nuclear weapons to the War in Vietnam.

It said that no matter how apparently senseless a governmental policy seemed to the unbriefed, there was certain knowledge, forbidden to all but our self-selecting guardians, in which lay the necessary components of reason. That argument didn't work for me then. It doesn't work for me now.

And it wouldn't have worked for Thomas Jefferson, who said: ""I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves, and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise that control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion."

It's time for the paternalism to end. And it's time we restored government by the people, such as we are, and not such as our fathers always wanted us to be.

Death From Above

For the March, 1995

Electronic Frontier column in Communications of the ACM

by John Perry Barlow

Over the last 30 years, the American CEO Corps has included an astonishingly large percentage of men who piloted bombers during World War II. For some reason not so difficult to guess, dropping explosives on people from commanding heights served as a great place to develop a world view compatible with the management of a large post-war corporation.

It was an experience particularly suited to the style of broadcast media. Aerial bombardment is clearly a one-to-many, half-duplex medium, offering the bomber a commanding position over his "market" and terrific economies of scale.

Now, most of these jut-jawed former flyboys are out to pasture on various golf courses, but just as they left their legacy in the still thriving Cold War machinery of the National Security State, so their cultural perspective remains deeply, perhaps permanently, embedded in the corporate institutions they led for so long, whether in media or manufacturing. America remains a place where companies produce and consumers consume in an economic relationship which is still as asymmetrical as that of bomber to bombee.

The lop-sided character of this world view has been much on my mind lately with regard to various corporate projects on what they are all too pleased to call the "Information Superhighway" (evoking as it does the familiar comforts of Big Construction by Big Government in cooperation with Big Business). The cable companies and Baby Bells have a model for developing the next phase of telecom infrastructure which, were it applied to the design of physical superhighways, would have us building them with about five thousand lanes in one direction and one lane in the other.

The only more manipulative consumer architecture I've seen is the quarter mile of one way conveyor belt which sucks the unsuspecting off the Strip in Vegas and drops them into the digestive maze of Caesar's Palace Casino without any return route at all.

Nursing such gloomy metaphors as these, I was encouraged to receive an e-mail message recently from Gordon Bell, one of the Titans of computing, with the cumbersome but evocative subject: line, "Building Cyberspace with One-way Streets - Bad idea? Conspiracy? Short-sightedness? Incompetence?'"

In it, he exhorted me and a number of better qualified digerati (including The Media Lab's Nicholas Negroponte and Bellcore Vice President and telecom god Bob Lucky) to put our "bodies in front of the backhoes that are installing asymmetric networks that simply mimic cable TV."

There followed a passionate argument against what appears to be the default asymmetry and the following vision of a better future: "The distinction and needs between homes and offices will disappear. Also, there needn't be places like information warehouses that are the sole video providers into the network to form new franchises and monopolies. Every home should, in principle, be capable of being a producer or consumer. This needs to be the goal of the information highway."

Unfortunately, as things stand, it isn't. At least it is in no way the goal of the institutions that currently building the more overtly commercial aspects of it. Whether cable companies or telcos, they see the NII as pay-per-view on steroids. They seem to envision their economic future in creating for the Generican consumer the ability to watch any movie or re-run without risking such human interaction as a trip to the video store might produce.

The strangest aspect of this vision (or trance) is that pay-per-view has been available for nearly twenty years and has never, to my knowledge, managed to penetrate more than 18% of its possible target market of cable subscribers. The idea that this unpopular service will power our economic future would seem preposterous on its face were not some many billions headed that way.

Institutions from John Malone's TCI to Oracle are building titanic video servers, the mothers of all mainframes, in order that they might blast down at you "My Mother, the Car" or "Motel Hell" at any moment you might hunger for that sort of thing. From these great repositories of digitized dreck will dangle a thatch of fiber/coax tentacles, one of which will presumably extend its coaxial tip into your living room.

One design model popular with the RBOC's and at least one cable company would initially offer a gigabit comin' at ya and about 200 kbps of back channel, presumably to support the "buy" button on the remote controller of your set-top box and other such boons of "Interactive" Television.

In this model, the telco runs a fiber into a neighborhood of about 500 homes, connecting subscribers to that point with coax and modems. Downstream from the distribution point there would be about 200 MHz available, from which the modems can derive about 5 bits per Hz., giving one gigabit for video services of whatever sort.

Upstream is a different story altogether. There you've only about 30 MHz. available in the whole neighborhood router, and the modems only derive about 2 bits per Hz., leaving a pool of 60 Mbps to be shared by the 300 customers, or, as I say, about 200 kbps. Not much more than AppleTalk.

To be honest, that's a little misleading. The back-channel 60 Mbps pool can be switched dynamically between users. Thus the average available might be as much as 1 Mpbs, given that not everybody in a neighborhood will be sending bits upstream all the time.

While this wouldn't be all the bandwidth a byte-pig like me might want, it would be a hell of a start. But there is also the question of whether it will even be available to the customer. Most of the models I've seen, cable or telco, seem to reserve it for their own purposes. I believe if they were willing to open it up to the users, they would, as Mitch Kapor speculates, "quickly find there was far more demand for the service than they imagined." Mitch goes on: "This would be agood thing as it would speed up their accepting the inevitable."

What about the economics? A full fiber installation might cost as much as $1500 per home. At 100 million homes, that's quite a bottom line. No one is seriously going to ask the telcos and cable companies to pop for an up front investment of 150 billion in a market even they can't seriously believe in, but one wonders why they are designing such hard asymmetry into their local distribution systems.

For one thing, this $1500 is only five hundred more than the $1000 which is the rough average cost of installing a new copper pair. Given that there are many new hookups, both cable and telco, installed daily and many equipment upgrades as well, it's probably more accurate to say that the incremental cost of nearly universal fiber-to-the-home would be something on the order of 20 to 25 billion. That's still real money, but a price one can imagine the market bearing.

Furthermore, it would seem a good bet on a highly imaginable future to lay dark fiber in these trenches while they're open, a relatively cheap thing to do, and to install the expensive parts - the lasers at each end - when the market is ready.

But very few of the new connections and upgrades being installed at the moment are taking advantage of the opportunity. When the trenches close they are, in most cases, closing on coax alone. Laying the fiber will require their being reopened.

There are other non-recoverable costs associated with the asymmetic approach the Big Boys seem stuck on. When the folks at the edges start clamoring for upstream capacity, it will be necessary to replace all those ADSL modems and other neighborhood routers of fixed asymmetry at a time when they will be, in my projections, fairly new. We can argue about the time frame, but it seems wasteful to be installing new equipment that will be junk sooner than not.

What are the economic or technical disadvantages of designing the fiber drop-to-home architecture so that it would provide flexible bandwidth allocation now, even allowing upstream asymmetry if called for? I mean, I thought one of the beauties of ATM was it ability to rapidly re-deploy routing and bandwidth on demand.

The answer I get back is that there is no serious demand for upstream services while the cable business has at least demonstrated a market for downstream services. If you take this answer seriously, which I don't, this is a little like a petroleum company stating in 1900 that since there wasn't much of a market for gasoline it was going to stick resolutely to medicinal oils, based on proven market demand. Fortunately, it wasn't too difficult to retool refineries to produce gas when the automobile hit big, but one wonders how much it's going to cost to replace all those fixed asymmetrical modems and .

Actually, I think it would take a market demonstration of retina-searing obviousness to veer the cable-tel dinosaurs lumbering in the direction of symmetry. In the meantime, there is a good chance such emerging mammals of local bit provision as Broad Band Technologies, Inc., WilTel, maybe even your local electric utility, will have done such a good job of addressing the upstream digital market that remaining entry share will be too limited to feed the thunder lizards.

It already seems obvious to me, and to anybody who's launched Mosaic lately, that the market for upstream bandwidth is about to explode. Bandwidth is one of those things like money, sex, and power. The more you've got, the shorter it feels. And there are now a critical number of Americans who know what bandwidth is and why is feels good.

Look at what's happened on the World Wide Web, where traffic grew 1,713% in 1994. (Which, though down from the previous year's 443,931%, is still pretty rapid growth.) These figures reflect a burgeoning generation of Web-sters under 25 who have already started to give up television in droves. Not even the instantaneous availability of every Brady Bunch episode is going to lure them back. They want to interact with other people, not "content," and they are using computers to do it.

Indeed, this generation's "what's your sign" pick-up question is already "where's your home page." And what's the point of having a home page you can't illuminate with QuickTime videos of yourself being morphed into a Klingon or an audio clip of the latest cut by your band? Kids like these are going to want their home pages at home and not on some distant server where security considerations are going to prohibit rapid, interactive updates. Furthermore, these are kids who went all the way through college at the end of a T1. They're as likely to patiently await images to form in the developing bath of modem transfer speeds as they are to take up a life of prayer and contemplation.

Businesses are rushing to put up Web sites which will contain their catalogues and from which people will be able to order all manner of goods, hard and soft. If you're selling anything made of bits, whether it's Photoshop filters or interactive pornographic films, you're not going to require your customers to receive their orders at 200 kbp. Nor will it make business sense to rent space in the virtual mall of one of Larry Ellison's monster nCube servers.

Then there are the increasingly fuzzy boundaries of the American work place. People are commuting less and traveling more. They want to be able to jack in, either at home or in the Marriot which all too often serves as home, and get the same access to information they have on the ethernet in their official office. Nobody wants to be on a LAN which runs at 14,400 baud, whether their office is traditional or virtual.

I could go on at great length but it wouldn't matter. I would convince no one in thetelcos or cable companies. The problem isn't the lack of a potential market. The problem isn't cost. The problem is consciousness. And culture. What they see is what you get.

This was especially evident to me recently when I had an opportunity to debate these issues publicly with John Malone at a conference at the University of Colorado. Now John Malone is a very smart man. Up close, he has, like Bill Gates, the kind of leaping intellectual force which is likely to make anyone feel like the lazy brown dog.

John Malone knows the media transport business. But when all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. He knows broadcast. He knows one-to-many. He knows strategic bombing. He is no more likely to recognize the potency of such guerrilla markets as are growing on the Web as General Curtis LeMay was to regard the Viet Cong as credible opposition.

I kept trying to convince him that there would be an enormous and growing upstream surge as more and more individuals and small businesses put up Web sites, rattling off a long list of all the things which are already appearing on them.

Finally he conceded the possibility with some exasperation, but said that even if he could see a way of making money there, providing upstream bandwidth was not necessarily a business he particularly wanted to be in. For almost theological reasons, he wanted TCI to remain in the center even if all the action moved to the edges.

In fairness, George Gilder thinks Malone may have been putting me on. When I mentioned this episode to Gilder, he said, "Faced with 150 channels of DBS competition, with better resolution and audio than the studio NTSC at the headend, cable has to serve computers with bandwidth or it will go out of business. All the cable people I talk to--including many who work for John Malone--know this very well." They may know it in their minds, but can they have the religious conversion necessary to know it in their hearts.

And indeed we are talking about religion here. On one side you've got the monotheism of Control, the one-to-many system which has dominated the West at least since the Industrial Revolution, possibly since Gutenberg; possibly since Moses. And done a damned fine job of creating civilization, I might add. A necessary thing in its day.

Surging toward these battlements of God Above All are the galloping, barbarous hoards of pantheism, guerrillas all, from the Cypherpunks to Newt Gingrich. I sometimes wonder which of these I really want to win, but I'm pretty sure which one is going to. It's B-52's vs. punji sticks. It's machine against nature. Sooner or later, nature takes the game.

No matter how much death they rained from above, the bombers lost Viet Nam. They're going to lose Cyberspace too. For exactly the same reasons.





Crime and Puzzlement
====================

by John Perry Barlow

Desperados of the DataSphere

So me and my sidekick Howard,  we was sitting out in front of the 40 Rod Saloon one evening  when he all of a sudden says, "Lookee  here.  What do you reckon?"  I look up and there's these two strangers riding into town. They're young and got kind of a restless, bored way about 'em.  A person don't  need both eyes to see they mean trouble...

Well, that wasn't quite how it went.  Actually, Howard and I were floating blind as cave fish in the electronic barrens of the WELL, so the whole incident passed as words on a display screen:

Howard:    Interesting couple of newusers just signed on.  One calls himself acid and the other's optik.

Barlow:    Hmmm.  What are their real names?

Howard:    Check their finger files.

And so I typed !finger acid.  Several seconds later the WELL's Sequent computer sent the following message to my Macintosh in Wyoming:

    Login name: acid

    In real life: Acid Phreak

By this, I knew that the WELL had a new resident and that his corporeal analog was supposedly called Acid Phreak.  Typing !finger optik yielded results of similar insufficiency, including the claim that someone, somewhere in the real world, was walking around calling himself Phiber Optik.  I doubted it.

However, associating these sparse data with the knowledge that the WELL was about to host a conference on computers and security rendered the conclusion that I had made my first sighting of genuine computer crackers.  As the arrival of an outlaw was a major event to the settlements of the Old West, so was the appearance of crackers cause for stir on the WELL.

The WELL (or Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) is an example of the latest thing in frontier villages, the computer bulletin board.  In this kind of small town, Main Street is a central minicomputer to which (in the case of the WELL) as many as 64 microcomputers may be connected at one time by phone lines and little blinking boxes called modems.

In this silent world, all conversation is typed.  To enter it, one forsakes both body and place and becomes a thing of words alone. You can see what your neighbors are saying (or recently said), but not what either they or their physical surroundings look like.  Town meetings are continuous and discussions rage on everything from sexual kinks to depreciation schedules.

There are thousands of these nodes in the United States, ranging from PC clone hamlets of a few users to mainframe metros like CompuServe, with its 550,000 subscribers.  They are used by corporations to transmit memoranda and spreadsheets, universities to disseminate research, and a multitude of factions, from apiarists to Zoroastrians, for purposes unique to each.

Whether by one telephonic tendril or millions, they are all connected to one another.  Collectively, they form what their inhabitants call the Net.  It extends across that immense region of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought which sci-fi writer William Gibson named Cyberspace.

Cyberspace, in its present condition, has a lot in common with the 19th Century West.  It is vast, unmapped, culturally and legally ambiguous, verbally terse (unless you happen to be a court stenographer), hard to get around in, and up for grabs.  Large institutions already claim to own the place, but most of the actual natives are solitary and independent, sometimes to the point of sociopathy.  It is, of course, a perfect breeding ground for both outlaws and new ideas about liberty.

Recognizing this, Harper's Magazine decided in December, 1989 to hold one of its periodic Forums on the complex of issues surrounding computers, information, privacy, and electronic intrusion or "cracking."  Appropriately, they convened their conference in Cyberspace, using the WELL as the "site."

Harper's invited an odd lot of about 40 participants.  These included: Clifford Stoll, whose book The Cuckoo's Egg details his cunning efforts to nab a German cracker.  John Draper or "Cap'n Crunch," the grand- daddy of crackers whose blue boxes got Wozniak and Jobs into consumer electronics.  Stewart Brand and Kevin Kelly of Whole Earth fame.  Steven Levy, who wrote the seminal Hackers.  A retired Army colonel named Dave Hughes.  Lee Felsenstein, who designed the Osborne computer and was once called the "Robespierre of computing."  A UNIX wizard and former hacker named Jeff Poskanzer.  There was also a score of aging techno-hippies, the crackers, and me.

What I was doing there was not precisely clear since I've spent most of my working years either pushing cows or song-mongering, but I at least brought to the situation a vivid knowledge of actual cow-towns, having lived in or around one most of my life.

That and a kind of innocence about both the technology and morality of Cyberspace which was soon to pass into the confusion of knowledge.

At first, I was inclined toward sympathy with Acid 'n' Optik as well as their colleagues, Adelaide, Knight Lightning, Taran King, and Emmanuel.  I've always been more comfortable with outlaws than Republicans, despite having more certain credentials in the latter camp.

But as the Harper's Forum mushroomed into a boom-town of ASCII text (the participants typing 110,000 words in 10 days), I began to wonder.  These kids were fractious, vulgar, immature, amoral, insulting, and too damned good at their work.

Worse, they inducted a number of former kids like myself into Middle Age.  The long feared day had finally come when some gunsel would yank my beard and call me, too accurately, an old fart.

Under ideal circumstances, the blind gropings of bulletin board discourse force a kind of Noh drama stylization on human commerce. Intemperate responses, or "flames" as they are called, are common even among conference participants who understand one another, which, it became immediately clear, the cyberpunks and techno- hippies did not.

My own initial enthusiasm for the crackers wilted under a steady barrage of typed testosterone.  I quickly remembered I didn't know much about who they were, what they did, or how they did it.  I also remembered stories about crackers working in league with the Mob, ripping off credit card numbers and getting paid for them in (stolen) computer equipment.

And I remembered Kevin Mitnik.  Mitnik, now 25, recently served federal time for a variety of computer and telephone related crimes. Prior to incarceration, Mitnik was, by all accounts, a dangerous guy with a computer.  He disrupted phone company operations and arbitrarily disconnected the phones of celebrities.  Like the kid in Wargames, he broke into the North American Defense Command computer in Colorado Springs.

Unlike the kid in Wargames, he is reputed to have made a practice of destroying and altering data. There is even the (perhaps apocryphal) story that he altered the credit information of his probation officer and other enemies.  Digital Equipment claimed that his depredations cost them more than $4 million in computer downtime and file rebuilding.  Eventually, he was turned in by a friend who, after careful observation, had decided he was "a menace to society."

His spectre began to hang over the conference.  After several days of strained diplomacy, the discussion settled into a moral debate on the ethics of security and went critical.

The techno-hippies were of the unanimous opinion that, in Dylan's words, one "must be honest to live outside the law."   But these young strangers apparently lived by no code save those with which they unlocked forbidden regions of the Net.

They appeared to think that improperly secured systems deserved to be violated and, by extension, that unlocked houses ought to be robbed.  This latter built particular heat in me since I refuse, on philosophical grounds, to lock my house.

Civility broke down.  We began to see exchanges like:

Dave Hughes:    Clifford Stoll said a wise thing that no one has commented on. That networks are built on trust. If they aren't, they should be.

Acid Phreak:    Yeah. Sure.  And we should use the 'honor system' as a first line of security against hack attempts.

Jef Poskanzer:    This guy down the street from me sometimes leaves his back door unlocked. I told him about it once, but he still does it.  If I had the chance to do it over, I would go in the back door, shoot him, and take all his money and consumer electronics.  It's the only way to get through to him.

Acid Phreak:    Jef Poskanker (Puss?  Canker?  yechh)  Anyway, now when did you first start having these delusions where computer hacking was even \*remotely\* similar to murder?

Presented with such a terrifying amalgam of raw youth and apparent power, we fluttered like a flock of indignant Babbitts around the Status Quo, defending it heartily.  One former hacker howled to the Harper's editor in charge of the forum, "Do you or do you not have names and addresses for these criminals?"  Though they had committed no obvious crimes, he was ready to call the police.

They finally got to me with:

Acid:         Whoever said they'd leave the door open to their house... where do you live?  (the address)  Leave it to me in mail if you like.

I had never encountered anyone so apparently unworthy of my trust as these little nihilists.  They had me questioning a basic tenet, namely that the greatest security lies in vulnerability.  I decided it was time to put that principal to the test...

Barlow:        Acid. My house is at 372 North Franklin Street in Pinedale, Wyoming. If you're heading north on Franklin, you go about two blocks off the main drag before you run into hay meadow on the left. I've got the last house before the field. The computer is always on...

        And is that really what you mean? Are you merely just the kind of little sneak that goes around looking for easy places to violate? You disappoint me, pal. For all your James Dean-On-Silicon rhetoric, you're not a cyberpunk. You're just a punk.

Acid Phreak:    Mr. Barlow:  Thank you for posting all I need to get your credit information and a whole lot more!  Now, who is to blame?  ME for getting it or YOU for being such an idiot?! I think this should just about sum things up.

Barlow:        Acid, if you've got a lesson to teach me, I hope it's not that it's idiotic to trust one's fellow man. Life on those terms would be endless and brutal. I'd try to tell you something about conscience, but I'd sound like Father O'Flannigan trying to reform the punk that's about to gutshoot him. For no more reason that to watch him die.

        But actually, if you take it upon yourself to destroy my credit, you might do me a favor. I've been looking for something to put the brakes on my burgeoning materialism.

I spent a day wondering whether I was dealing with another Kevin Mitnik before the other shoe dropped:

Barlow:        ... With crackers like acid and optik, the issue is less intelligence than alienation.  Trade their modems for skateboards and only a slight conceptual shift would occur.

Optik:         You have some pair of balls comparing my talent with that of a skateboarder.  Hmmm...  This was indeed boring, but nonetheless: At which point he downloaded my credit history.

Optik had hacked the core of TRW, an institution which has made my business (and yours) their business, extracting from it an abbreviated ( and incorrect) version of my personal financial life. With this came the implication that he and Acid could and would revise it to my disadvantage if I didn't back off.

I have since learned that while getting someone's TRW file is fairly trivial, changing it is not.  But at that time, my assessment of the crackers'  black skills was one of superstitious awe.  They were digital brujos  about to zombify my economic soul.

To a middle-class American, one's credit rating has become nearly identical to his freedom.  It now appeared that I was dealing with someone who had both the means and desire to hoodoo mine, leaving me trapped in a life of wrinkled bills and money order queues.  Never again would I call the Sharper Image on a whim.

I've been in redneck bars wearing shoulder-length curls, police custody while on acid, and Harlem after midnight, but no one has ever put the spook in me quite as Phiber Optik did at that moment.  I realized that we had problems which exceeded the human conductivity of the WELL's bandwidth.  If someone were about to paralyze me with a spell, I wanted a more visceral sense of him than could fit through a modem.

I e-mailed him asking him to give me a phone call.  I told him I wouldn't insult his skills by giving him my phone number and, with the assurance conveyed by that challenge, I settled back and waited for the phone to ring.  Which, directly, it did.

In this conversation and the others that followed I encountered an intelligent, civilized, and surprisingly principled kid of 18 who sounded, and continues to sound, as though there's little harm in him to man or data.  His cracking impulses seemed purely exploratory, and I've begun to wonder if we wouldn't also regard spelunkers as desperate criminals if AT&T owned all the caves.

The terrifying poses which Optik and Acid had been striking on screen were a media-amplified example of a human adaptation I'd seen before: One becomes as he is beheld.  They were simply living up to what they thought we, and, more particularly, the editors of Harper's, expected of them.  Like the televised tears of disaster victims, their snarls adapted easily to mass distribution.

Months later, Harper's took Optik, Acid and me to dinner at a Manhattan restaurant which, though very fancy, was appropriately Chinese.  Acid and Optik, as material beings, were well-scrubbed and fashionably-clad. They looked to be dangerous as ducks.  But, as Harper's and the rest of the media have discovered to their delight, the boys had developed distinctly showier personae for their rambles through the howling wilderness of Cyberspace.

Glittering with spikes of binary chrome, they strode past the kleig lights and into the digital distance.  There they would be outlaws.  It was only a matter of time before they started to believe themselves as bad as they sounded.  And no time at all before everyone else did.

In this, they were like another kid named Billy, many of whose feral deeds in the pre-civilized West were encouraged by the same dime novelist who chronicled them.  And like Tom Horn, they seemed to have some doubt as to which side of the law they were on.  Acid even expressed an ambition to work for the government someday, nabbing "terrorists and code abusers."

There is also a frontier ambiguity to the "crimes" the crackers commit.  They are not exactly stealing VCR's.  Copying a text file from TRW doesn't deprive its owner of anything except informational exclusivity.  (Though it may said that information has monetary value only in proportion to its containment.)

There was no question that they were making unauthorized use of data channels.  The night I met them, they left our restaurant table and disappeared into the phone booth for a long time.  I didn't see them marshalling quarters before they went.

And, as I became less their adversary and more their scoutmaster, I began to get "conference calls" in which six or eight of them would crack pay phones all over New York and simultaneously land on my line in Wyoming.  These deft maneuvers made me think of sky- diving stunts where large groups convene geometrically in free fall. In this case, the risk was largely legal.

Their other favorite risky business is the time-honored adolescent sport of trespassing.  They insist on going where they don't belong. But then teen-age boys have been proceeding uninvited since the dawn of human puberty.  It seems hard-wired.  The only innovation is in the new form of the forbidden zone the means of getting in it.

In fact, like Kevin Mitnik, I broke into NORAD when I was 17.  A friend and I left a nearby "woodsie" (as rustic adolescent drunks were called in Colorado) and tried to get inside the Cheyenne Mountain.  The chrome-helmeted Air Force MP's held us for about 2 hours before letting us go.  They weren't much older than us and knew exactly our level of national security threat.  Had we come cloaked in electronic mystery, their alert status certainly would have been higher.

Whence rises much of the anxiety.  Everything is so ill-defined.  How can you guess what lies in their hearts when you can't see their eyes? How can one be sure that, like Mitnik, they won't cross the line from trespassing into another adolescent pastime, vandalism?  And how can you be sure they pose no threat when you don't know what a threat might be?

And for the crackers some thrill is derived from the metamorphic vagueness of the laws themselves.  On the Net, their effects are unpredictable. One never knows when they'll bite.

This is because most of the statutes invoked against the crackers were designed in a very different world from the one they explore.  For example, can unauthorized electronic access can be regarded as the ethical equivalent of old-fashioned trespass?  Like open range, the property boundaries of Cyberspace are hard to stake and harder still to defend.

Is transmission through an otherwise unused data channel really theft?  Is the track-less passage of a mind through TRW's mainframe the same as the passage of a pickup through my Back 40?  What is a place if Cyberspace is everywhere?  What are data and what is free speech?  How does one treat property which has no physical form and can be infinitely reproduced?  Is a computer the same as a printing press?  Can the history of my business affairs properly belong to someone else?  Can anyone morally claim to own knowledge itself?

If such questions were hard to answer precisely, there are those who are ready to try.  Based on their experience in the Virtual World, they were about as qualified to enforce its mores as I am to write the Law of the Sea.  But if they lacked technical sophistication, they brought to this task their usual conviction.  And, of course, badges and guns.

Operation Sun Devil

"Recently, we have witnessed an alarming number of young people who, for a variety of  sociological and psychological reasons, have become attached to their  computers and are  exploiting their potential in a criminal manner. Often, a progression of  criminal activity  occurs which involves telecommunications fraud (free long distance phone  calls),  unauthorized access to other computers (whether for profit, fascination, ego,  or the intellectual challenge), credit card fraud (cash advances and unauthorized purchases of  goods), and then move on to other destructive activities like computer  viruses."

"Our experience shows that many computer hacker suspects are no longer misguided  teenagers mischievously playing games with their computers in their  bedrooms.  Some are  now high tech computer operators using computers to engage in unlawful conduct."--    Excerpts from a statement by Garry M. Jenkins Asst. Director, U. S. Secret Service

"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against  unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants  shall issue but  upon probable cause, support by oath or affirmation, and particularly  describing the place  to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."--    Amendment IV United States Constitution

On January 24, 1990, a platoon of Secret Service agents entered the apartment which Acid Phreak shares with his mother and 12 year-old sister.  The latter was the only person home when they burst through the door with guns drawn.  They managed to hold her at bay for about half an hour until their quarry happened home.

By then, they were nearly done packing up Acid's worldly goods, including his computer, his notes (both paper and magnetic), books, and such dubiously dangerous tools as a telephone answering machine, a ghetto blaster and his complete collection of audio tapes. One agent asked him to define the real purpose of the answering machine and was frankly skeptical when told that it answered the phone.  The audio tapes seemed to contain nothing but music, but who knew what dark data Acid might have encoded between the notes...

When Acid's mother returned from work, she found her apartment a scene of apprehended criminality.  She asked what, exactly, her son had done to deserve all this attention and was told that, among other things, he had caused the AT&T system crash several days earlier. (Previously AT&T had taken full responsibility.) Thus, the agent explained, her darling boy was thought to have caused over a billion dollars in damage to the economy of the United States.

This accusation was never turned into a formal charge.  Indeed, no charge of any sort of was filed against Mr. Phreak then and, although the Secret Service maintained resolute possession of his hardware, software, and data, no c harge had been charged 4 months later.

Across town, similar scenes were being played out at the homes of Phiber Optik and another colleague code-named Scorpion.  Again, equipment, notes, disks both hard and soft, and personal effects were confiscated.  Again no charges were filed.

Thus began the visible phase of Operation Sun Devil, a two-year Secret Service investigation which involved 150 federal agents, numerous local and state law enforcement agencies. and the combined security resources of PacBell, AT&T, Bellcore, Bell South MCI, U.S. Sprint, Mid-American, Southwestern Bell, NYNEX, U.S. West and American Express.

The focus of this impressive institutional array was the Legion of Doom, a group which never had any formal membership list but was thought by the members with whom I spoke to number less than 20, nearly all of them in their teens or early twenties.

I asked Acid why they'd chosen such a threatening name.  "You wouldn't want a fairy kind of thing like Legion of Flower Pickers or something.  But the media ate it up too.  Probing the Legion of Doom like it was a gang or something, when really it was just a bunch of geeks behind terminals."

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Sometime in December 1988, a 21 year-old Atlanta-area Legion of Doomster named The Prophet cracked a Bell South computer and downloaded a three-page text file which outlined, in bureaucrat-ese of surpassing opacity, the administrative procedures and responsibilities for marketing, servicing, upgrading, and billing for Bell South's 911 system.

A dense thicket of acronyms, the document was filled with passages like:

"In accordance with the basic SSC/MAC strategy for provisioning, the SSC/MAC will be  Overall Control Office (OCO) for all Notes to PSAP circuits (official services)  and any  other services for this customer.  Training must be scheduled for all  SSC/MAC involved  personnel during the pre-service stage of the project." And other such.

At some risk, I too have a copy of this document.  To read the whole thing straight through without entering coma requires either a machine or a human who has too much practice thinking like one. Anyone who can understand it fully and fluidly has altered his consciousness beyond the ability to ever again read Blake, Whitman, or Tolstoy.  It is, quite simply, the worst writing I have ever tried to read.

Since the document contains little of interest to anyone who is not a student of advanced organizational sclerosis...that is, no access codes, trade secrets, or proprietary information...I assume The Prophet only copied this file as a kind of hunting trophy.  He had been to the heart of the forest and had returned with this coonskin to nail to the barn door.

Furthermore, he was proud of his accomplishment, and since such trophies are infinitely replicable, he wasn't content to nail it to his door alone.  Among the places he copied it was a UNIX bulletin board (rather like the WELL) in Lockport, Illinois called Jolnet.

It was downloaded from there by a 20 year-old hacker and pre-law student (whom I had met in the Harper's Forum) who called himself Knight Lightning.  Though not a member of the Legion of Doom, Knight Lightning and a friend, Taran King, also published from St. Louis and his fraternity house at the University of Missouri a worldwide hacker's magazine called Phrack.  (From phone phreak and hack.)

Phrack was an unusual publication in that it was entirely virtual.  The only time its articles hit paper was when one of its subscribers decided to print out a hard copy.  Otherwise, its editions existed in Cyberspace and took no physical form.

When Knight Lightning got hold of the Bell South document, he thought it would amuse his readers and reproduced it in the next issue of Phrack.  He had little reason to think that he was doing something illegal.  There is nothing in it to indicate that it contains proprietary or even sensitive information.  Indeed, it closely resembles telco reference documents which have long been publicly available.

However, Rich Andrews, the systems operator who oversaw the operation of Jolnet, thought there might be something funny about the document when he first ran across it in his system.  To be on the safe side, he forwarded a copy of it to AT&T officials.  He was subsequently contacted by the authorities, and he cooperated with them fully.  He would regret that later.

On the basis of the forgoing, a Grand Jury in Lockport was persuaded by the Secret Service in early February to hand down a seven count indictment against The Prophet and Knight Lightning, charging them, among other things, with interstate transfer of stolen property worth more than $5,000.  When The Prophet and two of his Georgia colleagues were arrested on February 7, 1990, the Atlanta papers reported they faced 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine.  Knight Lightning was arrested on February 15.

The property in question was the affore-mentioned blot on the history of prose whose full title was A Bell South Standard Practice (BSP) 660-225-104SV-Control Office Administration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major Account Centers, March, 1988.

And not only was this item worth more than $5,000.00, it was worth, according to the indictment and Bell South, precisely $79,449.00.  And not a penny less.  We will probably never know how this figure was reached or by whom, though I like to imagine an appraisal team consisting of Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, and Thomas Pynchon...

In addition to charging Knight Lightning with crimes for which he could go to jail 30 years and be fined $122,000.00, they seized his publication, Phrack, along with all related equipment, software and data, including his list of subscribers, many of whom would soon lose their computers and data for the crime of appearing on it.

I talked to Emmanuel Goldstein, the editor of 2600, another hacker publication which has been known to publish purloined documents. If they could shut down Phrack, couldn't they as easily shut down 2600?

He said, "I've got one advantage.  I come out on paper and the Constitution knows   how to deal with paper."

In fact, nearly all publications are now electronic at some point in their creation.  In a modern newspaper, stories written at the scene are typed to screens and then sent by modem to a central computer. This computer composes the layout in electronic type and the entire product transmitted electronically to the presses.  There, finally, the bytes become ink.

Phrack merely omitted the last step in a long line of virtual events. However, that omission, and its insignificant circulation, left it vulnerable to seizure based on content.  If the 911 document had been the Pentagon Papers (another proprietary document) and Phrack the New York Times, a completion of the analogy would have seen the government stopping publication of the Times and seizing its every material possession, from notepads to presses.

Not that anyone in the newspaper business seemed particularly worried about such implications.  They, and the rest of the media who bothered to report Knight Lightning's arrest were too obsessed by what they portrayed as actual disruptions of emergency service and with marvelling at the sociopathy of it.  One report expressed relief that no one appeared to have died as a result of the "intrusions."

Meanwhile, in Baltimore, the 911 dragnet snared Leonard Rose, aka Terminus.  A professional computer consultant who specialized in UNIX, Rose got a visit from the government early in February.  The G-men forcibly detained his wife and children for six hours while they interrogated Rose about the 911 document and ransacked his system.

Rose had no knowledge of the 911 matter.  Indeed, his only connection had been occasional contact with Knight Lightning over several years...and admitted membership in the Legion of Doom. However, when searching his hard disk for 911 evidence, they found something else.  Like many UNIX consultants, Rose did have some UNIX source code in his possession.   Furthermore, there was evidence that he had transmitted some of it to Jolnet and left it there for another consultant.

UNIX is a ubiquitous operating system, and though its main virtue is its openness to amendment at the source level, it is nevertheless the property of AT&T.  What had been widely d  istributed within businesses and universities for years was suddenly, in Rose's hands, a felonious possession.

Finally, the Secret Service rewarded the good citizenship of Rich Andrews by confiscating the computer where Jolnet had dwelt, along with all the e-mail, read and un-read, which his subscribers had left there.  Like the many others whose equipment and data were taken by the Secret Service subsequently, he wasn't charged with anything. Nor is he likely to be.  They have already inflicted on him the worst punishment a nerd can suffer: data death.

Andrews was baffled.  "I'm the one that found it, I'm the one that turned it in...And I'm the one that's suffering," he said.

One wonders what will happen when they find such documents on the hard disks of CompuServe.  Maybe I'll just upload my copy of Bell South Standard Practice (BSP) 660-225-104SV and see...

In any case, association with stolen data is all the guilt you need.  It's quite as if the government could seize your house simply because a guest left a stolen VCR in an upstairs bedroom closet.  Or confiscate all the mail in a post office upon finding a stolen package there. The first concept of modern jurisprudence to have arrived in Cyberspace seems to have been Zero Tolerance.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Rich Andrews was not the last to learn about the Secret Service's debonair new attitude toward the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizure.

Early on March 1, 1990, the offices of a role-playing game publisher in Austin, Texas called Steve Jackson Games were visited by agents of the United States Secret Service.  They ransacked the premises, broke into several locked filing cabinets (damaging them irreparably in the process) and eventually left carrying 3 computers, 2 laser printers, several hard disks, and many boxes of paper and floppy disks.

Later in the day, callers to the Illuminati BBS (which Steve Jackson Games operated to keep in touch with roll-players around the country) encountered the following message:

"So far we have not received a clear explanation of what the Secret Service was looking  for, what they expected to find, or much of anything else. We are fairly certain  that Steve  Jackson Games is not the target of whatever investigation is being conducted;  in any case,  we have done nothing illegal and have nothing whatsoever to hide.  However, the  equipment that was seized is apparently considered to be evidence in  whatever they're investigating, so we aren't likely to get it back any time soon. It could be a month, it could  be never."

It's been three months as I write this and, not only has nothing been returned to them, but, according to Steve Jackson, the Secret Service will no longer take his calls.  He figures that, in the months since the raid, his little company has lost an estimated $125,000.  With such a fiscal hemorrhage, he can't afford a lawyer to take after the Secret Service.  Both the state and national offices of the ACLU told him to "run along" when he solicited their help.

He tried to go to the press.  As in most other cases, they were unwilling to raise the alarm.  Jackson theorized, "The conservative press is taking the attitude that the suppression of evil hackers is a good thing and that anyone who happens to be put out of business in the meantime...well, that's just their tough luck."

In fact, Newsweek did run a story about the event, portraying it from Jackson's perspective, but they were almost alone in dealing with it.

What had he done to deserve this nightmare?  Role-playing games, of which Dungeons and Dragons is the most famous, have been accused of creating obsessive involvement in their nerdy young players, but no one before had found it necessary to prevent their publication.

It seems that Steve Jackson had hired the wrong writer.  The managing editor of Steve Jackson Games is a former cracker,  known by his fellows in the Legion of Doom as The Mentor.  At the time of the raid, he and the rest of Jackson staff had been working for over a year on a game called GURPS Cyberpunk, High-Tech Low-Life Role- Playing.

At the time of the Secret Service raids, the game resided entirely on the hard disks they confiscated.  Indeed, it was their target.  They told Jackson that, based on its author's background, they had reason to believe it was a "handbook on computer crime."  It was therefore inappropriate for publication, 1st Amendment or no 1st Amendment.

I got a copy of the game from the trunk of The Mentor's car in an Austin parking lot.  Like the Bell South document, it seemed pretty innocuous to me, if a little inscrutable.   Borrowing its flavor from the works of William Gibson and Austin sci-fi author Bruce Sterling, it is filled with silicon brain implants, holodecks, and gauss guns.

It is, as the cover copy puts it, "a fusion of the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Timothy Leary." Actually, without the gizmos, it describes a future kind of like the present its publisher is experiencing at the hands of the Secret Service.

An unbelievably Byzantine world resides within its 120 large pages of small print.  (These roll-players must be some kind of idiots savants...)  Indeed, it's a thing of such complexity that I can't swear there's no criminal information in there, but then I can't swear that Grateful Dead records don't have satanic messages if played backwards.  Anything's possible, especially inside something as remarkable as Cyberpunk.

The most remarkable thing about Cyberpunk is the fact that it was printed at all.  After much negotiation, Jackson was able to get the Secret Service to let him have some of his data back.  However, they told him that he would be limited to an hour and a half with only one of his three computers.  Also, according to Jackson, "They insisted that all the copies be made by a Secret Service agent who was a two- finger typist.  So we didn't get much. "

In the end, Jackson and his staff had to reconstruct most of the game from neural rather than magnetic memory.  They did have a few very old backups, and they retrieved some scraps which had been passed around to game testers.  They also had the determination of the enraged.

Despite government efforts to impose censorship by prior restraint, Cyberpunk is now on the market.  Presumably, advertising it as "The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service" will invigorate sales. But Steve Jackson Games, the heretofore prosperous publisher of more than a hundred role-playing games, has been forced to lay off more than half of its employees and may well be mortally wounded.

Any employer who has heard this tale will think hard before he hires a computer cracker.  Which may be, of course, among the effects the Secret Service desires.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

On May 8, 1990, Operation Sun Devil, heretofore an apparently random and nameless trickle of Secret Service actions, swept down on the Legion of Doom and its ilk like a bureaucratic tsunami.  On that day, the Secret Service served 27 search warrants in 14 cities from Plano, Texas to New York, New York.

The law had come to Cyberspace.  When the day was over, transit through the wide open spaces of the Virtual World would be a lot trickier.

In a press release following the sweep, the Secret Service boasted having shut down numerous computer bulletin boards, confiscated 40 computers, and seized 23,000 disks.  They noted in their statement that "the conceivable criminal violations of this operation have serious implications for the health and welfare of all individuals, corporations, and United States Government agencies relying on computers and telephones to communicate."

It was unclear from their statement whether "this operation" meant the Legion of Doom or Operation Sun Devil.  There was room to interpret it either way.

Because the deliciously ironic truth is that, aside from the 3 page Bell South document, the hackers had neither removed nor damaged anyone's data. Operation Sun Devil, on the other hand, had "serious implications" for a number of folks who relied on "computers and telephones to communicate." They lost the equivalent of about 5.4 million pages of information.  Not to mention a few computers and telephones.

And the welfare of the individuals behind those figures was surely in jeopardy.  Like the story of the single mother and computer consultant in Baltimore whose sole means of supporting herself and her 18 year old son was stripped away early one morning.  Secret Service agents broke down her door with sledge hammers, entered with guns drawn, and seized all her computer equipment. Apparently her son had also been using it...

Or the father in New York who opened the door at 6:00 AM and found a shotgun at his nose.  A dozen agents entered.  While one of the kept the man's wife in a choke-hold, the rest made ready to shoot and entered the bedroom of their sleeping 14 year-old.  Before leaving, they confiscated every piece of electronic equipment in the house, including all the telephones.

It was enough to suggest that the insurance companies should start writing policies against capricious governmental seizure of circuitry.

In fairness, one can imagine the government's problem.  This is all pretty magical stuff  to them.  If I were trying to terminate the operations of a witch coven, I'd probably seize everything in sight. How would I tell the ordinary household brooms from the getaway vehicles?

But as I heard more and more about the vile injustices being heaped on my young pals in the Legion of Doom, not to mention the unfortunate folks nearby, the less I was inclined toward such temperate thoughts as these.  I drifted back into a 60's-style sense of the government, thinking it a thing of monolithic and evil efficiency and adopting an up-against-the-wall willingness to spit words like "pig" or "fascist" into my descriptions.

In doing so, I endowed the Secret Service with a clarity of intent which no agency of government will ever possess.  Despite almost every experience I've ever had with federal authority, I keep imagining its competence.

For some reason, it was easier to invest the Keystone Kapers of Operation Sun Devil with malign purpose rather than confront their absurdity straight-on.  There is, after all, a twisted kind of comfort in political paranoia.  It provides one such a sense of orderliness to think that the government is neither crazy nor stupid and that its plots, though wicked, are succinct.

I was about to have an experience which would restore both my natural sense of unreality and my unwillingness to demean the motives of others.  I was about to see first hand the disorientation of the law in the featureless vastness of Cyberspace.

In Search of NuPrometheus

"I pity the poor immigrant..."

--    Bob Dylan

Sometime last June, an angry hacker got hold of a chunk of the highly secret source code which drives the Apple Macintosh.  He then distributed it to a variety of addresses, claiming responsibility for this act of information terrorism in the name of the Nu  Prometheus League.

Apple freaked.  NuPrometheus had stolen, if not the Apple crown jewels, at least a stone from them.  Worse, NuPrometheus had then given this prize away.  Repeatedly.

All Apple really has to offer the world is the software which lies encoded in silicon on the ROM chip of every Macintosh.  This set of instructions is the cyber-DNA which makes a Macintosh a Macintosh.

Worse, much of the magic in this code was put there by people who not only do not work for Apple any longer, but might only do so again if encouraged with cattle prods.  Apple's attitude toward its ROM code is a little like that of a rich kid toward his inheritance.  Not actually knowing how to create wealth himself, he guards what he has with hysterical fervor.

Time passed, and I forgot about the incident.  But one recent May morning, I leaned that others had not.  The tireless search for the spectral heart of NuPrometheus finally reached Pinedale, Wyoming, where I was the object of a two hour interview by Special Agent Richard Baxter, Jr.  of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Poor Agent Baxter didn't know a ROM chip from a Vise-grip when he arrived, so much of that time was spent trying to educate him on the nature of the thing which had been stolen.  Or whether "stolen"was the right term for what had happened to it.

You know things have rather jumped the groove when potential suspects must explain to law enforcers the nature of their alleged perpetrations.

I wouldn't swear Agent Baxter ever got it quite right.  After I showed him some actual source code, gave a demonstration of e-mail in action, and downloaded a file  from the WELL, he took to rubbing his face with both hands, peering up over his finger tips and saying, "It sure is something, isn't it"  Or, "Whooo-ee."

Or "my eight year-old knows more about these things than I do."  He didn't say this with a father's pride so much as an immigrant's fear of a strange new land into which he will be forcibly moved and in which his own child is a native.  He looked across my keyboard into Cyberspace and didn't like what he saw.

We could have made it harder for one another, but I think we each sensed that the other occupied a world which was as bizarre and nonsensical as it could be. We did our mutual best to suppress immune response at the border.

You'd have thought his world might have been a little more recognizable to me.  Not so, it turns out.  Because in his world, I found several unfamiliar features, including these:

1.    The Hacker's Conference is an underground organization of computer outlaws with likely connections to, and almost certainly sympathy with, the NuPrometheus League.  (Or as Agent Baxter repeatedly put it, the "New Prosthesis League.")

2.    John Draper, the affore-mentioned Cap'n Crunch, in addition to being a known member of the Hacker's Conference, is also CEO and president of Autodesk, Inc.  This is of particular concern to the  FBI because Autodesk has many top-secret contracts with the government to supply Star Wars graphics imaging and "hyperspace" technology.  Worse, Draper is thought to have Soviet contacts.

He wasn't making this up.  He had lengthy documents from the San Francisco office to prove it.  And in which Autodesk's address was certainly correct.

On the other hand, I know John Draper. While, as I say, he may have once distinguished himself as a cracker during the Pleistocene, he is not now, never has been, and never will be CEO of Autodesk.  He did work there for awhile last year, but he was let go long before he got in a position to take over.

Nor is Autodesk, in my experience with it, the Star Wars skunk works which Agent Baxter's documents indicated.  One could hang out there a long time without ever seeing any gold braid.

Their primary product is something called AutoCAD, by far the most popular computer-aided design software but generally lacking in lethal potential.  They do have a small development program in Cyberspace, which is what they call Virtual Reality.  (This, I assume is the "hyperspace" to which Agent Baxter's documents referred.)

However, Autodesk had reduced its Cyberspace program to a couple of programmers. I imagined Randy Walser and Carl Tollander toiling away in the dark and lonely service of their country.  Didn't work. Then I tried to describe Virtual Reality to Agent Baxter, but that didn't work either.  In fact, he tilted.  I took several runs at it, but I could tell I was violating our border agreements. These seemed to include a requirement that neither of us try to drag the other across into his conceptual zone.

I fared a little better on the Hacker's Conference.  Hardly a conspiracy, the Hacker's Conference is an annual convention originated in 1984 by the Point Foundation and the editors of Whole Earth Review.  Each year it invites about a hundred of the most gifted and accomplished of digital creators. Indeed, they are the very people who have conducted the personal computer revolution.  Agent Baxter looked at my list of Hacker's Conference attendees and read their bios.

"These are the people who actually design this stuff, aren't they?"  He was incredulous.  Their corporate addresses didn't fit his model of outlaws at all well.

Why had he come all the way to Pinedale to investigate a crime he didn't understand which had taken place (sort of) in 5 different places, none of which was within 500 miles?

Well, it seems Apple has told the FBI that they can expect little cooperation from Hackers in and around the Silicon Valley, owing to virulent anti-Apple sentiment there.  They claim this is due to the Hacker belief that software should be free combined with festering resentment of Apple's commercial success.  They advised the FBI to question only those Hackers who were as far as possible from the twisted heart of the subculture.

They did have their eye on some local people though.  These included a couple of former Apple employees, Grady Ward and Water Horat, Chuck Farnham (who has made a living out of harassing Apple), Glenn Tenney (the purported leader of the Hackers), and, of course, the purported CEO of Autodesk.

Other folks Agent Baxter asked me about included Mitch Kapor, who wrote Lotus 1-2-3 and was  known to have received some this mysterious source code.  Or whatever.  But I had also met Mitch Kapor, both on the WELL and in person.  A less likely computer terrorist would be hard to come by.

Actually, the question of the source code was another area where worlds but shadow-boxed.  Although Agent Baxter didn't know source code from Tuesday, he did know that Apple Computer had told his agency that what had been stolen and disseminated was the complete recipe for a Macintosh computer.  The distribution of this secret formula might result in the creation of millions of Macintoshes not made by Apple.  And, of course, the ruination of Apple Computer.

In my world, NuPrometheus (whoever they, or more likely, he might be) had distributed a small portion of the code which related specifically to Color QuickDraw.  QuickDraw is Apple's name for the software which controls the Mac's on-screen graphics.  But this was another detail which  Agent Baxter could not capture.  For all he knew, you could grow Macintoshes from floppy disks.

I explained to him that Apple was alleging something like the ability to assemble an entire human being from the recipe for a foot, but even he know the analogy was inexact.  And trying to get him to accept the idea that a corporation could go mad with suspicion was quite futile.  He had a far different perception of the emotional reliability of institutions.

When he finally left, we were both dazzled and disturbed.  I spent some time thinking about Lewis Carroll and tried to return to writing about the legal persecution of the Legion of Doom.  But my heart wasn't in it.  I found myself suddenly too much in sympathy with Agent Baxter and his struggling colleagues from Operation Sun Devil to get back into a proper sort of pig-bashing mode.

Given what had happened to other innocent bystanders like Steve Jackson, I gave some thought to getting scared.  But this was Kafka in a clown suit.  It wasn't precisely frightening.  I also took some comfort in a phrase once applied to the administration of Frederick the Great: "Despotism tempered by incompetence."

Of course, incompetence is a double-edged banana.  While we may know this new territory better than the authorities, they have us literally out-gunned.  One should pause before making well-armed paranoids feel foolish, no matter how foolish they seem.

The Fear of White Noise

"Neurosis is the inability to tolerate ambiguity."

--    Sigmund Freud,

    appearing to me in a dream

I'm a member of that half of the human race which is inclined to divide the human race into two kinds of people.  My dividing line runs between the people who crave certainty and the people who trust chance.

You can draw this one a number of ways, of course, like Control vs. Serendipity, Order vs. Chaos, Hard answers vs. Silly questions, or Newton, Descartes & Aquinas vs. Heisenberg, Mandelbrot & the Dalai Lama.  Etc.

Large organizations and their drones huddle on one end of my scale, busily trying to impose predictable homogeneity on messy circumstance.  On the other end, free-lancers and ne'er-do-wells cavort about, getting by on luck  if they get by at all.

However you cast these poles, it comes down to the difference between those who see life as a struggle against cosmic peril and human infamy and those who believe, without any hard evidence, that the universe is actually on our side.  Fear vs. Faith.

I am of the latter group.  Along with Gandhi and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, I believe that other human beings will quite consistently merit my trust if I'm not doing something which scares them or makes them feel bad about themselves.  In other words, the best defense is a good way to get hurt.

In spite of the fact that this system works very reliably for me and my kind, I find we are increasingly in the minority.  More and more of our neighbors live in armed compounds.  Alarms blare continuously. Potentially happy people give their lives over to the corporate state as though the world were so dangerous outside its veil of collective immunity that they have no choice.

I have a number of theories as to why this is happening.  One has to do with the opening of Cyberspace.  As a result of this development, humanity is now undergoing the most profound transformation of its history.  Coming into the Virtual World, we inhabit Information. Indeed, we become Information.  Thought is embodied and the Flesh is made Word.  It's weird as hell.

Beginning with the invention of the telegraph and extending through television into Virtual Reality, we have been, for a over a century, experiencing a terrifying erosion in our sense of both body and place. As we begin to realize the enormity of what is happening to us, all but the most courageous have gotten scared.

And everyone, regardless of his psychic resilience, feels this overwhelming sense of strangeness.  The world, once so certain and tangible and legally precise, has become an infinite layering of opinions, perceptions, litigation, camera-angles, data, white noise, and, most of all, ambiguities.  Those of us who are of the fearful persuasion do not like ambiguities.

Indeed, if one were a little jumpy to start with, he may now be fairly humming with nameless dread.  Since no one likes his dread to be nameless, the first order of business is to find it some names.

For a long time here in the United States, Communism provided a kind of catch-all bogeyman.  Marx, Stalin and Mao summoned forth such a spectre that, to many Americans, annihilation of all life was preferable to the human portion's becoming Communist.  But as Big Red wizened and lost his teeth, we began to cast about for a replacement.

Finding none of sufficient individual horror, we have draped a number of objects with the old black bunting which once shrouded the Kremlin.  Our current spooks are terrorists, child abductors, AIDS, and the underclass.  I would say drugs, but anyone who thinks that the War on Drugs is not actually the War on the Underclass hasn't been paying close enough attention. There are a couple of problems with these Four Horsemen.  For one thing, they aren't actually very dangerous.  For example, only 7 Americans died in worldwide terrorist attacks in 1987.  Fewer than 10 (out of about 70 million) children are abducted by strangers in the U.S. each year.  Your chances of getting AIDS if you are neither gay nor a hemophiliac nor a junkie are considerably less than your chances of getting killed by lightning while golfing.  The underclass is dangerous, of course, but only, with very few exceptions, if you are a member of it.

The other problem with these perils is that they are all physical.  If we are entering into a world in which no one has a body, physical threats begin to lose their sting.

And now I come to the point of this screed:  The perfect bogeyman for Modern Times is the Cyberpunk!  He is so smart he makes you feel even more stupid than you usually do.  He knows this complex country in which you're perpetually lost.  He understands the value of things you can't conceptualize long enough to cash in on.  He is the one-eyed man in the Country of the Blind.

In a world where you and your wealth consist of nothing but beeps and boops of micro-voltage, he can steal all your assets in nanoseconds and then make you disappear.

He can even reach back out of his haunted mists and kill you physically.  Among the justifications for Operation Sun Devil was this chilling tidbit:

"Hackers had the ability to access and review the files of hospital patients. Furthermore,  they could have  added, deleted, or altered vital patient information, possibly  causing life- threatening situations."

Perhaps the most frightening thing about the Cyberpunk is the danger he presents to The Institution, whether corporate or governmental.  If you are frightened you have almost certainly taken shelter by now in one of these collective organisms, so the very last thing you want is something which can endanger your heretofore unassailable hive.

And make no mistake, crackers will become to bureaucratic bodies what viruses presently are to human bodies.  Thus, Operation Sun Devil can be seen as the first of many waves of organizational immune response to this new antigen.  Agent Baxter was a T-cell. Fortunately, he didn't know that himself and I was very careful not to show him my own antigenic tendencies.

I think that herein lies the way out of what might otherwise become an Armageddon between the control freaks and the neo-hip.  Those who are comfortable with these disorienting changes must do everything in our power to convey that comfort to others.  In other words, we must share our sense of hope and opportunity with those who feel that in Cyberspace they will be obsolete eunuchs for sure.

It's a tall order.  But, my silicon brothers, our self-interest is strong.  If we come on as witches, they will burn us.  If we volunteer to guide them gently into its new lands, the Virtual World might be a more amiable place for all of us than this one has been.

Of course, we may also have to fight.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Defining the conceptual and legal map of Cyberspace before the ambiguophobes do it for us (with punitive over-precision) is going to require some effort.  We can't expect the Constitution to take care of itself.  Indeed, the precedent for mitigating the Constitutional protection of a new medium has already been established.  Consider what happened to radio in the early part of this century.

Under the pretext of allocating limited bandwidth, the government established an early right of censorship over broadcast content which still seems directly unconstitutional to me.  Except that it stuck.  And now, owing to a large body of case law, looks to go on sticking.

New media, like any chaotic system, are highly sensitive to initial conditions.  Today's heuristical answers of the moment become tomorrow's permanent institutions of both law and expectation. Thus, they bear examination with that destiny in mind.

Earlier in this article, I asked a number of tough questions relating to the nature of property, privacy, and speech in the digital domain. Questions like:  "What are data and what is free speech?" or  "How does one treat property which has no physical form and can be infinitely reproduced?"  or  "Is a computer the same as a printing press."  The events of Operation Sun Devil were nothing less than an effort to provide answers to these questions.  Answers which  would greatly enhance governmental ability to silence the future's opinionated nerds.

In over-reaching as extravagantly as they did, the Secret Service may actually have done a service for those of us who love liberty.  They have provided us with a devil.  And devils, among their other galvanizing virtues, are just great for clarifying the issues and putting iron in your spine.  In the presence of a devil, it's always easier to figure out where you stand.

While I previously had felt no stake in the obscure conundra of free telecommunication, I was, thanks to Operation Sun Devil, suddenly able to plot a trajectory from the current plight of the Legion of Doom to an eventual constraint on opinions much dearer to me.  I remembered Martin Neimoeller, who said:

"In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a  Communist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I  wasn't a Jew.   They came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a  trade unionist.   Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a  Protestant.  Then  they came for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up."

I decided it was time for me to speak up.

The evening of my visit from Agent Baxter, I wrote an account of it which I placed on the WELL.   Several days later, Mitch Kapor literally dropped by for a chat.

Also a WELL denizen, he had read about Agent Baxter and had begun to meditate on the inappropriateness of leaving our civil liberties to be defined by the technologically benighted.  A man who places great emphasis on face-to-face contact, he wanted to discuss this issue with me in person.  He had been flying his Canadair bizjet to a meeting in California when he realized his route took him directly over Pinedale.

We talked for a couple of hours in my office while a spring snowstorm swirled outside.  When I recounted for him what I had learned about Operation Sun Devil, he decided it was time for him to speak up too.

He called a few days later with the phone number of a civil libertarian named Harvey Silverglate, who, as evidence of his conviction that everyone deserves due process, is   currently defending Leona Helmsley.  Mitch asked me to tell Harvey what I knew, with the inference that he would help support the costs which are liable to arise whenever you tell a lawyer anything.

I found Harvey in New York at the offices of that city's most distinguished constitutional law firm, Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky, and Lieberman.  These are the folks who made it possible for the New York Times to print the Pentagon Papers.  (Not to dwell on the unwilling notoriety which partner Leonard Boudin achieved back in 1970 when his Weathergirl daughter blew up the family home...)

In the conference call which followed, I could almost hear the skeletal click as their jaws dropped.  The next day, Eric Lieberman and Terry Gross of Rabinowitz, Boudin met with Acid Phreak, Phiber Optik, and Scorpion.

The maddening trouble with writing this account is that Whole Earth Review, unlike, say, Phrack, doesn't publish instantaneously.  Events are boiling up at such a frothy pace that anything I say about current occurrences surely will not obtain by the time you read this.  The road from here is certain to fork many times.  The printed version of this will seem downright quaint before it's dry.

But as of today (in early June of 1990), Mitch and I are legally constituting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a two (or possibly three) man organization which will raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.

Already, on the strength of preliminary stories about our efforts in the Washington Post and the New York Times, Mitch has received an offer from Steve Wozniak to match whatever funds he dedicates to this effort.  (As well as a fair amount of abuse from the more institutionalized precincts of the computer industry.)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation will fund, conduct, and support legal efforts to demonstrate that the Secret Service has exercised prior restraint on publications, limited free speech, conducted improper seizure of equipment and data, used undue force, and generally conducted itself in a fashion which is arbitrary, oppressive, and unconstitutional.

In addition, we will work with the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and other organizations to convey to both the public and the policy-makers metaphors which will illuminate the more general stake in liberating Cyberspace.

Not everyone will agree.  Crackers are, after all, generally beyond public sympathy.  Actions on their behalf are not going to be popular no matter who else might benefit from them in the long run.

Nevertheless, in the litigations and political debates which are certain to follow, we will endeavor to assure that their electronic speech is protected as certainly as any opinions which are printed or, for that matter, screamed.  We will make an effort to clarify issues surrounding the distribution of intellectual property.  And we will help to create for America a future which is as blessed by the Bill of Rights as its past has been.

Cynthia Horner's Eulogy
=======================

Date: Sat, 23 Apr 1994 12:05:36 -0800

From: John Perry Barlow <barlow@eff.org>

I know that news of her death is circulating the Net and I'm getting an incredible outpouring of shock and sympathy. For any good it might do, I hope you will post this to some of the places where news of her death has appeared. I mean it to stand as her gravestone in the virtual world.

Cynthia Horner's Eulogy

read by John Perry Barlow at her funeral April 22, 1994 in Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, BC..

I don't know most of you, and I envy the many among you who were graced with Cynthia all her life. I only knew her a little while.  We spent the last glorious year of her life together. It was the best year of my life and, I firmly believe, it was the best year of her life too.

Last Sunday morning, during the last hour we spent together, we were playing with a cat which strangely green eyes.

She looked at me with her own beautiful green eyes and said, "You know, James Joyce said that green eyes were a sign of the supernatural." The way she said it seemed pointed and meaningful. And hope makes me want to believe it all the more meaningful now.

I don't know that I believe in the supernatural, but I do believe in miracles, and our time together was filled with the events of magical unlikelihood. I also believe that sometimes angels live among us, hidden within our fellow human beings. I'm convinced that such an angel dwelled in Cynthia. I felt this presence often in Cynthia's lightness of being, in her decency, her tolerance, her incredible love. I never heard Cynthia speak ill of anyone nor did I ever hear anyone speak ill of her. She gave joy and solace to all who met her.

I feel her angel still, dancing around the spiritual periphery, just beyond the sight of my eyes, narrowed as they are with the glare of ordinary light. Her graceful goodness continues to surround me, if less focused and tangible than before.

With a care that was appropriately reverential, Cynthia and I built a love which was an inspiration to all who came into contact with it. We felt, quite consciously, that it was our gift to the world. We wanted to show the hesitant the miracle that comes when two people give their hearts unconditionally, honestly, fearlessly, and without reservation or judgement. We wanted to make our union into a message of hope, and I believe we did, even though we knew that hearts opened so freely can be shattered if something should go wrong. As my heart is shattered now.

So among the waves of tragedy which have crashed on me with her death is a terror that our message of hope has been changed into a dreadful warning. But I am here to tell you that had I known at the beginning that I would be here today doing this terrible thing, I would still have loved her as unhesitatingly, because true love is worth any price one is asked to pay.

The other message we wished to convey was one of faith in the essential goodness and purpose of life. I have always felt that no matter how inscrutable its ways and means, the universe is working perfectly and working according to a greater plan than we can know. In the last few days, I have had to battle with the fear that everything is actually just random, that the universe is a howling void of meaningless chaos, indifferent to everything that I value. All hope has at times seemed unjustified to me.

But groundless hope, like unconditional love, is the only kind worth having.

It's true name is faith. As it is a shallow faith which goes untested, so it is that if we can keep our faith through this terrible test, we will emerge with a conviction of incredible and enduring strength. And this faith will become Cynthia's greatest gift to us. If we can build with our lives a monument to her light and her love, she will not have died in vain, and her death will become as much a miracle as was her life.





Go Placidly Amidst the Noise and Haste
======================================

GO PLACIDLY AMIDST THE NOISE AND HASTE

JOHN PERRY BARLOW

Co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation

NPQ \| When the Republicans swept into control of the house and senate this past election and the counter-counter culture emerged triumphant, part of their promise has been to reestablish a sense of order in the current chaos by strengthening local communities and American values. Such promised change extends well beyond public policy as does their attack on the last liberal bastion and fomenter of instability - the media. Do you see media in the same way and is the media in the grasp of a liberal elite?

JOHN PERRY BARLOW \| I don't believe in a media elite. I do believe in a media organism and this organism exists in the space between the people who create the media and the people who consume them - the media exist to confirm the delusions of the crowd. That is what the media are there for, to reify every hysterical belief that the mob might suddenly espouse. So what we are dealing with here is a collective hallucination - what Guy Debord called the Spectacle. A completely coherent, seamless loop exists that is continuous between the great engine of fear that is television and the terror of the populace. The media have managed a complete departure of the map from the landscape.

If you think of this in terms of cybernetic systems, you will see that in nature, there is not only negative feedback and equalization, there are also positive feedback loops. The accelerator gets stuck to the floor until the whole damn thing crashes. That is where we are with the media right now. The media live on the attention of the audience. Audience attention is what they sell advertisers, which makes it the energy source, the photons in their ecology. And there are a few simple ways to capture the attention of the audience - sex, violence and fear. Given this fact, the media has every reason to optimize for these three things. And they do.

So out there in television land you get a constant battery of terror and sexuality of a particularly virtual and toxic sort. Gradually the effect is that people become less willing to go out and engage in experience because everything the information channel is telling you is that experience is dangerous and it would be best to just stay in your home and suck down information all day. People don't get out and have the experiences that would correct their misapprehension of the terrors of the world.  In the past, the way in which people have always determined what was appropriately frightening was to go out and engage it, feel it, use the entire sensorium to analyze the environment and determine the actuality of threat.

NPQ \| ...and not only does TV separate you from tangible experience, it also goes to places where you might not easily get to, like Somalia...

BARLOW \| Hell, you can't go to television! It doesn't make any difference if it is a very familiar place - it can't really take you anywhere at all. What you perceive through that one-way mirror is not an experience. It is information, it is alienated experience, it is eviscerated, it doesn't have much of the nutritional material that real experience has. The problem with television is that it mimics experience so much better than other media. When reading the newspaper, you know that you are not there, you are reading the paper. As Magritte said, you can't eat the menu -  it's like his painting of a pipe that's labeled "This is not a pipe." Exactly! this is a picture of a pipe.

By the same token, television has a way of making you think, "Hey, I am there!" Bullshit! You are not there, that is not your point of view, it is somebody else's point of view, you don't even know whose it is! Thus arises the hallucination. And, the answer to this hallucination, if there is one, is media that are much better at conveying experience over distance. The central difference between experience and information is that experience allows you to ask questions of your surroundings in real-time. Ask questions through the medium. Use your own senses. Experience is truly interactive.

NPQ \| If TV were interactive, would we be able to penetrate the hallucination?

BARLOW \| I think that TV is basically irredeemable. There is some possibility of "re-experientializing" information by things like telepresence. And in a very thin form it exists now, in the sense that instead of having to take uncritically the feed that comes from the networks about some horrible event, the Internet allows some direct communication with people on the scene. It is possible to ask those people questions, which one cannot do of CNN.

It is important to find who was there on the scene, form a newsgroup or an e-mail relationship with them. This is the initial phase. I think that ultimately the World Wide Web will become a place where people will engage in telepresence. We will be able to click on something and be able to map everything from the surrounding temperature to the pheromones into our own sensoriums. It might be almost like being there eventually.

In the Internet, in particular, we have this magnificent engine of anarchy that is growing logarithmically - faster than anything that size has ever grown. Processor velocity is speeding up, bandwidth is going to increase a gazillion-fold. There is no known upper limit on what you can shove through fiber optic cable with ATM - you can put many, many gigabits through a single strand of fiber. The next problem will be the sort, the edit - narrowing all these data down to something which has meaning. If there is an undifferentiated white spew of information coming at you, it is like trying to take a sip out of the firehose - and it will get worse.

NPQ \| Newt Gingrich has hinted that the Internet can help shore up local community by helping any American detach themselves from mass media. But, doesn't Gingrich see that this super-dynamic system that is plugged right into people's homes is introducing more chaos than stability, stability needed to achieve his goals?

BARLOW \| Gingrich sees opportunities and perils, but, part of the reason that there appears to be more paradox here than there is, is that it is very easy to conflate Gingrich and his group with the Christian fundamentalists. There are two very different kinds of Republicans in power at the moment. While they have a lot in common stylistically and culturally - they all like hair spray, for example - but they don't have much in common philosophically. The fundamentalists and the libertarians have big divisions. But Republicans are very good at denial, public denial. They are very good at producing a monolithic front to the world because a lot of what Republicanism is about culturally is the nuclear family, another denial-based institution. So they have a lot of practice at it.

The real question that I have of Gingrich and his group is that although we agree that in this unregulatable environment, ethics will have to replace laws; ethics are based on a culture and the question is: Whose culture? Gingrich's response is: "The American culture."

NPQ \| What is the American culture?

BARLOW \| That's the problem. The American culture either doesn't exist anymore or exists in a potpourri of stuff that is only a culture when taken as a whole and not down at the level of particularity that is required to form coherent ethics. There is perhaps one ethic that is agreed upon throughout America - the Golden Rule - and even this is not so generally practiced. Go down to the more granular ethical level - the mores of individual culture, whether it is the African-American community or people with cowboy boots - and you get more variation on the particular questions of right and wrong.

NPQ \| We need to respect our diversity...

BARLOW \| And we need to figure out what we agree upon as a species. The central problem is this: The organism does not stop at the skin. There are concentric virtual organisms that go all the way up to the vanishing point, and each one of those organisms has an immune response.  Culture is a collective organism, and one of the things that every organism does is continuously define the self versus the other. Now there are various ways of doing this, some of which are more aggressive and hostile than others, but every culture has its methods. As we enter into a global condition where these organisms are in continuous grating contact with one another. They will having their communities strengthened by the Internet, and at the same time called into question by direct interaction with other communities. One gloomy of the future is that it will look like the Balkans everywhere.

One way of avoiding this is with over-arching cultural homogeneity. Some see family values as central to American culture. But I am increasingly starting to wonder if the whole idea of the nuclear family and the impulse toward nuclear family values is also part of the hallucination. I wonder if it isn't something else that exists more on the map than the landscape. It seems that the American family model is a cultural delusion so close to being shattered that all we can do is sit and wait.

People are stuck in a tightening internal gridlock over the most important of human issues, sexuality They're locked in Televisionland - the isolated, hermetically-sealed suburbanite is getting a steady feed of really high-temperature sexuality that doesn't relate to any part of their experience, which is, in fact, becoming more desexualized all the time. They're not getting any and they're sitting around watching MTV. Rock and roll is the fire below - it's not Mozart - it's about dancing and sex.

NPQ \| Can blame, then, be placed, for example, on record company executives for producing music that increases this tension?

BARLOW \| But this is exactly the thing! To say "I've got this terrible pressure inside me, I'm going to have the government solve it. I've got this thing that I cannot deal with internally, so I'm going to ask the entire nation to deal with it for me." It's the Shadow. You can blame the abstraction, but the abstraction is not the people, the problem is the entire process. Blame the process - hate the sin not the sinner.  Here again, people are being conditioned not to know what real satisfaction is. They have been pumped up with an hallucination that doesn't exist anywhere except in Coke ads.

NPQ \| Is there hope for the next generation? Will we see a coming of age?

BARLOW \| I hope so. Society is healthier when there is some degree of consensus. And when society becomes neurotic, like ours is, that which can no longer be held by consensus has to be held by force. Anytime coercion is needed to give people coherence, the game is lost because force never prevails over the long haul. In the short term though, I fear we haven't seen the maximum display of force. We will go through a cycle of repression, with the degree of that repression depending on how savagely the ambiguophobes will try to impose an impossible certainty on the world.

There are, though, as many forces operating against repression as there are operating for it; and the interesting thing is that this time they are not lining up in a symmetry that tends to amplify both sides. The anti-repressive forces are going around authority. They are evading confrontation, ignoring it. There used to be a bumper sticker that said "Question Authority." Now it says "Question Reality," which is a much more adept and insidious method for dealing with the problem. You just don't play. You opt out. You still have to render unto Caesar, but as little as possible.

I take hope in tribal gatherings of those people under 30 who don't seem to be particularly fear-based. There is an extended familial quality, the way they treat each other is very affectionate, there is a real sense of togetherness without the fear of being bound. I might be over-optimistic, but, every time I get around them, I feel good about things. Through them, perhaps, we can achieve the most important task, which is getting to the global "we accept the diversity" level.

NPQ \| In the short term, is there a central authority? Who is Caesar?

BARLOW \| I think that central authority is usually an illusion. When President Clinton first got into the White House, they asked Mitch Kapor and me to come in and talk about the information infrastructure. And we realized that they didn't have any clearer grasp of this than we did - it was a scary moment. I looked at Mitch and I said "Where's Dad?" And he said "I'm afraid we're Dad."

The transformative realization that followed was that it has always been like this. We have always tended to imagine government as though it were a Prussian unity - a hierarchical and mechanical model in which the wheel house connected to the rudder with everything moving according to a design. The reality is that muddle through according to the Italian model - government by that which emerges from chaos. And in this chaos, we need to shift; we need to quit believing in the comforting delusion of that structure and start relying on that which will emerge. It is like making plans that you know you don't intend to adhere to, but you make them because there is something comforting about having plans. Ultimately, centralized anything is going to be greatly de-emphasized and re-distributed. This is what we are all experiencing - all of the current power relationships on the planet are currently being disassembled. It's going up into the air.

Here is the bottom line - we are going from monotheism to pantheism for the first time in 2500 years.  And all these Judeo-Christian-Islamic orders in which the great white stone of God squat on all are about to unravel. And, as much as I might want to, I have a feeling that I will not entirely like the future that will arise in its stead. It will be a lot more contentious, tribal warfare. Molecular civil war. Dirty little wars, street fights, riots, hand to hand combat  - the Third World becomes the whole world.  Whether that defines the dominant flavor of being human is an open question. It probably won't. I think the overriding flavor of being human ultimately will be the disappearance of the self altogether.

NPQ \| The evolution of the human species into a higher plane.

BARLOW \| Right into the Collective Organism of Mind. When every synapse on this planet is actually hard-wired to every other synapse, so that there is a continuous connection between all the wetware of humanity, then something new probably starts to happen.

NPQ \| What are the new structures emerging out of this? What, then, will lend shape to this chaotic future?

BARLOW \| As we are learning from research into natural complexity, chaos is actually filled with shape. Beneath the swirling surface there are certain ordering principles to all natural systems that are actually quite simple. Look at all the odd little recursive patterns that seem to order so many things. Take, for example, the Fibonacci Series. This is the spiraling progression found in, say, the nautilus shell - one, three, seven, thirteen - the next number is that number added to the sum of the previous numbers. This can be found all over the place.  And there are those break points in chaotic systems where a smooth laminar flow of either events or materials suddenly becomes chaotic or turbulent. And between the point of initial chaos and complete disorganization certain strangely orderly things happen, basins of attraction appear in the space of what is possible.

My hope is that what we will become more comfortable organizing ourselves around these basins of attraction - economic interests, collective self-interests of various sorts. They will replace our rigid power structures. Basins of attraction are not geographical but cultural. The Chinese as a cultural group over the face of the planet will become a major basin of attraction. There will be a natural accumulation of economic power and as a consequence military and cultural power. And among the Chinese both as a nation as a distributed culture. The Arab world is also a basin of attraction.

NPQ \| What about America?

BARLOW \| Unlike Gingrich, I don't think that America as a cultural institution willbe a clearly definable phenomenon. And as a political institution I think it is going to go away altogether. Nevertheless, in 200 years, the global information organism will still have a distinctly American flavor. There may be no America to taste like, but the Web will feel American in some respects. I think it will still have the sense of liberated possibility, the never-ending frontier. In the terrestrial sense there is no more frontier in America, or any place else. My family had been on freshly plowed ground as far back as the genealogical horizon, and in my generation, I ran up against the loss of frontier, there was no more new ground to plow. So, I headed off to cyberspace.

NPQ \| The image of earth as a full house now comes to mind - exponentially increasing numbers of people contributing to global culture and global chaos.

BARLOW \| Connection crash. Natural systems, when they get too many connections - when the web is too horizontal and doesn't have a hierarchical component at all - will start to fibrillate. The information can't organize itself into something like an equilibrium. The way in which consciousness works is by narrowing down reality into something perceptible, something tolerable that won't blind you - because the thing itself, whatever it is that might be the True Phenomenon of Reality, is a thing of such complexity and motion that to behold it raw would make you crazy instantly.

We are now, as a global group, going into a period where the old editorial system, the old way of stopping down consciousness to a bearable aperture is about to get blasted.  Our future will require us to reorganize our filters along completely different lines. I am confident that other methods will develop to stop it down in other ways. But they are not going to look like anything that we are familiar with. I think it is sufficient at this point to say, hey, everything is going to be different and we don't know how and we are proceeding at a high and accelerating velocity through the fog.

NPQ \| ...bravely...

BARLOW \| Let's try to do so bravely, since we are going there whether we want to or not. Let's go there with a sense of opportunity and excitement and not merely with a sense of dread and dislocation. The one thing that we can have some control over is the attitude with which we do things. If we can proceed, like that phrase from Desiderata. "placidly amidst the noise and haste." That is how I am trying to do it. I feel sane, but the world around me is crazy, truly surreal. I feel like the eye of my own hurricane.

Pullquote - The media have managed a complete departure of the map from the landscape.

Pullquote - Out there in Televisionland you get a constant battery of terror and sexuality of a particularly virtual and toxic sort.

Pullquote - Communities will be strengthened by the Internet and at the same time called into question by direct interaction with other communities.

Pullquote - Rock and roll is the fire below - its not Mozart - its about dancing and sex.

Pullquote - In this chaos, we need to shift; we need to quit believing in the comforting delusion of structure and start relying on that which will emerge.





Is There a There in Cyberspace?
===============================

for Utne Reader

by John Perry Barlow

There's no there there.

         --Gertrude Stein (speaking of Oakland)

It ain't no Amish barn-raising in there....

        --Bruce Sterling (speaking of Cyberspace)

I am often asked how I went from pushing cows around a remote Wyoming ranch to my present occupation (which Wall Street Journal recently called a "Cyberspace cadet").  I haven't got a short answer, but I suppose I came to the virtual world looking for community.

Unlike most modern Americans, I grew up in an actual place, an entirely non-intentional community called Pinedale, Wyoming. As I struggled for nearly a generation to keep my ranch in the family, I was motivated by the belief that such places were the spiritual home of humanity. But I knew their future was not promising.

At the dawn of the 20th Century, over 40% of the American work force lived off the land. The majority of us lived in towns like Pinedale. Now fewer than 1% of us extract their living from the soil. We just became too productive for our own good.

Of course, the population followed the jobs. Farming and ranching communities are now home to a demographically insignificant percentage of Americans, the vast majority of whom live not in ranch houses but in more or less identical split-level "ranch homes" in more or less identical suburban "communities." Generica.

In my view, these are neither communities nor homes. I believe the combination of television and suburban population patterns is simply toxic to the soul. I see much evidence in contemporary America to support this view.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, doom impended. And, as I watched community in Pinedale growing ill from the same economic forces that were killing my family's ranch, the Bar Cross, satellite dishes brought the cultural infection of television. I started looking around for evidence that community in America would not perish altogether.

I took some heart in the mysterious nomadic City of the Deadheads, that virtually physical town which follows the Grateful Dead around the country. The Deadheads lacked place, touching down briefly on whatever location the band happened to be playing and they lacked continuity in time, since they had to suffer a new Diaspora every time the band moved on or went home.

But they had many of the other necessary elements of community, including a culture, a religion of sorts (which , though it lacked dogma, had most of the other, more nurturing aspects of spiritual practice), a sense of necessity, and, most importantly, shared adversity.

I wanted to know more about the flavor of their interaction, what they thought and felt, but since I wrote Dead songs, I was a minor icon to the Deadheads, and was thus inhibited, in some socially Heisenbergian way, from getting a clear view into what really went on among them.

Then, in 1987, I heard about a "place" were they could gather continuously and where I might come amongst them without distorting too much the field of observation. Better, this was a place I could visit without leaving Wyoming. It was a shared computer in Sausalito, California called the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link or WELL. After a lot of struggling with modems, serial cables, init strings, and other computer arcana which seemed utterly out of phase with such notions as Deadheads or small towns, I found myself looking at the glowing yellow word, "Login:" beyond which lay my future.

"Inside" the WELL, were Deadheads in community. There were thousands of them there, gossiping, complaining (mostly about the Grateful Dead), comforting and harassing each other, bartering, engaging in religion (or at least exchanging their totemic set-lists), beginning and ending love affairs, praying for one another's sick kids. There was, it seemed, about everything one might find going on in a small town, save dragging Main or making out on the back roads.

I was delighted. I felt I had found the new locale of human community...never mind that the whole thing was being conducted in mere words by minds from whom the bodies had been amputated. Never mind that all these people were deaf, dumb, and blind as paramecia or that their town had neither seasons nor sunsets nor smells.

Surely all these deficiencies would be somehow remedied by richer, faster communications media. These featureless login handles would gradually acquire video faces (and thus, expressions), shaded 3-D body puppets (and thus body language). This "space," which I recognized at once to be a primitive form of the Cyberspace Bill Gibson had predicted in his sci-fi novel Neuromancer, was still without apparent dimensions or vistas. But Virtual Reality would change all that in time.

Meanwhile, The Commons, or something like it,  had been rediscovered. Once again, people from the 'Burbs had a place where they could randomly encounter their friends as my fellow Pinedalians did at the Post Office or the Wrangler Cafe. They had a place their hearts could remain as the companies they worked for shuffled their bodies around America. They could put down roots which could not be ripped out by forces of economic history. They had a collective stake. They had a community.

It is seven years now since I discovered the WELL. In that time, I co-founded an organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, dedicated to protecting its interests and those of other virtual communities like it from raids by physical government. I've spent countless hours typing away at its residents, and I've watched the larger context which contains it, the Internet, grow at such an explosive rate that, by 2004, every human on the planet would have an e-mail address unless the growth curve flattens (which it will).

My enthusiasm for virtual community has cooled. In fact, unless one counts interaction with the rather too large society of those with whom I exchange electronic mail, I don't spend much time engaging in virtuality at all. Many of the near-term benefits I anticipated from it seem to remain as far in the future as they did when I first logged in. Perhaps they always will.

The WELL has changed astonishingly little, which one would generally consider an asset in a small town. Pinedale hasn't changed that much either. And the majority in both places seem to adhere to the common rural dictum, "Even if it is broke, don't fix it."  (In my experience, only Bolinas, California rivals Pinedale for the obduracy of its conservatism.)

But Pinedale works, more or less, as it is, and there is a lot which is still missing from the communities of Cyberspace, whether they be places like the WELL, the fractious newsgroups of USENET, the silent "auditoriums"of American Online, or even enclaves on the promising World Wide Web.

What is missing? Well, to quote Ranjit Makkuni of Xerox PARC, "The prana is missing," prana being the Hindu term for both breath and spirit. I think he is right about this and that perhaps the central question of the Virtual Age is whether or not prana can somehow be made to fit through any medium but the act of Being There.

Prana is, to my mind, the literally vital element in the holy and unseen ecology of relationship, the dense meshwork of invisible life, on whose surface carbon-based life floats like a thin scum. It is at the heart of the fundamental and profound difference between information and experience. Jaron Lanier has said that "information is alienated experience," and, that being true, prana is part of what is removed when you create such easily transmissible replicas of experience as, say, the Evening News.

Obviously a great many other, less spiritual, things are also missing entirely, like body language, sex, death, tone of voice, clothing, beauty (or homeliness), weather, violence, vegetation, wildlife, pets, architecture, music, smells, sunlight, and that ol' Harvest Moon. In short, most of the things which make my life real to me.

Present, but in far less abundance than in the physical world which I call "Meatspace," are women, children, old people, poor people, and the genuinely blind. Also mostly missing are the illiterate and the continent of Africa. There isnot much human diversity in Cyberspace, consisting as it largely does of white males under 50 with plenty of computer terminal time, great typing skills, high math SAT's, strongly held opinions on just about everything, and an excruciating face to face shyness, especially with the opposite sex.

But diversity is as essential to healthy community as it is to healthy ecosystems (which are, in my view, different from communities only in unimportant aspects).

I believe that the principal reason for the almost universal failure of the intentional communities of the 60's and early 70's was a lack of diversity in their members. It was a rare commune with any old people in it, or people who were fundamentally out of philosophical agreement with the majority.

Indeed, it is the usual problem when we try to build something which can only be grown. Natural systems, such as human communities, are simply too complex to design by the engineering principles which we insist on applying to them. Like Dr. Frankenstein, Western Civilization is now finding its rational skills inadequate to the task of creating and stewarding life. We would do better to return to a kind of agricultural mind-set in which we humbly try to recreate the conditions from which life has sprung before. And leave the rest to God.

Given that it has been built so far almost entirely by people with engineering degrees, it is not so surprising that Cyberspace has the kind of overdesigned quality which leaves out all kinds of elements which Nature would have invisibly provided.

Also missing from both the communes of the 60's and from Cyberspace are a couple of elements which I believe are very important, if not essential, to the formation and preservation of real community. They are an absence of alternatives and a sense of genuine adversity, generally shared. What about these?

It is hard to argue that anyone would find the loss of his modem literally hard to survive, while many have remained in small towns, have tolerated their intolerances and created entertainment to enliven their culturally arid lives simply because it seemed there was no choice but to stay. There are many investments, spiritual, material, and temporal, one is willing to put into a home one cannot leave. Communities are often the beneficiaries of these somewhat involuntary investments.

But when the going gets rough in Cyberspace, it is even easier to move than it is in the 'Burbs, where, given the fact that the average American moves some 17 times in his or her life, moving appears to be pretty easy. One can not only find another BBS or newsgroup to hang out in, she can, with very little effort, start her own.

And then there is the bond of joint suffering. I think most community is a cultural stockade erected against a common Enemy which can take many forms. In Pinedale, we forbore together, with an understanding needing little expression, the fact that Upper Green River Valley is the coldest spot, as measured by annual mean temperature, in the lower 48 states. We knew that if somebody were stopped by the road most winter nights, he would probably die there, so the fact that we might loath him was no sufficient reason to drive on past his broken pickup.

By the same token, the Deadheads have the DEA, which strives to give them 20 year terms without parole for distributing the fairly harmless sacrament of their faith. They have an additional bond in the fact when their Microbuses die, as they often do, no one but another Deadhead is likely to stop to help them.

But what are the shared adversities of Cyberspace? Lousy user interfaces? The flames of harsh invective? Dumb jokes? Surely these can all be survived without the sanctuary provided by fellow sufferers.

One is always free to yank the jack, as I have mostly done. For me, the physical world offers far more opportunity for prana-rich connections with my fellow creatures. Even for someone whose body is in a state of perpetual motion, I feel I can generally find more community among the still-embodied.

Finally, there is that shyness factor. Not only are we trying to build community here among people who have never experienced any in my sense of the term, we are trying to building community among people who, in their lives, have rarely used the word "we" in a heartfelt way. It is a vast club, many of the members of which are people who, as Groucho Marx said, wouldn't want join a club which would have them as members.

And yet...

How quickly physical community continues to deteriorate. Even Pinedale, which seems to have economically survived the plague of ranch failures, feels increasingly cut off from itself. Many of the ranches are now owned by corporate types who fly their Gulfstreams in to fish and are rarely around during the many months when the creeks are frozen over and neighbors are needed. They have kept the ranches financially alive, but they actively discourage their managers from the interdependency which my colleagues and I required. They keep agriculture on life-support, still alive but lacking a functional heart.

And the town has been inundated with surburbanites who flee here, bringing all their terrors and suspicions with them. They spend their evenings as they did in Orange County, watching television, or socializing in hermetic little enclaves of fundamentalist Christianity which seem to separate them from us and even, given their sectarian inter-animosities, from one another. The town remains. The community is largely a wraith of nostalgia.

So where else do we have to look for the connection necessary to prevent our plunging further into the condition of separateness which Neitzsche called sin? What is there to do but to dive further into the bramble bush of information which, in its broadcast forms, has done so much to tear us apart?

Cyberspace, for all its current deficiencies and failed promises, is not without some very real solace already.

Some months ago, the great love of my life, a vivid young woman with whom I intended to spend the rest of it, dropped dead of undiagnosed viral cardiomyopathy two days short of her thirtieth birthday. I felt as if my own heart had been as shredded as hers.

We had lived together in New York City. Except for my daughters, no one from Pinedale had met her. I needed a community to wrap around myself against what seemed colder winds than fortune had ever blown at me before. And without looking, I found I had one in the Virtual World.

On the WELL, there was a topic announcing her death in one of the conferences to which I posted the eulogy I had read over her before burying her in her own small town of Nanaimo, British Columbia. It seemed to strike a chord among the disembodied living of the Net. People copied it and sent it to one another. Over the next several months I received almost a megabyte of electronic mail from all over the planet, mostly from folks whose faces I have never seen and probably never will.

They told me of their own tragedies and what they had done to survive them. As humans have since words were first uttered, we shared the second most common human experience, death, with an open-heartedness that would have caused grave uneasiness in physical America, where the whole topic is so cloaked in denial as to be considered obscene. Those strangers, who had no arms to put around my shoulders, no eyes to weep with mine, nevertheless saw me through it. As neighbors do.

I have no idea how far we will plunge into this strange place. Unlike previous frontiers, there is no end to this one. It is so dissatisfying in so many ways that I suspect we will be more restless in our search for home here than in all our previous explorations. And that is one reason why I think we may find it after all.

But if home is where the heart is, then there is already some part of home to be found in Cyberspace.

So... Does virtual community work or not? Should we all go off to Cyberspace or should we resist it as an even more demonic form of symbolic abstraction? Does it supplant the real or is there, in it, reality itself?

I'm sorry. Like so many true things, it doesn't resolve itself to a black or a white. Nor is it gray. It is, along with the rest of life, black/white. Both/neither. I'm not being equivocal or wishy-washy here. We have to get over our Manichean sense that everything is either good or bad, and the border of Cyberspace seems to me a good place to leave that old set of filters.

But really it doesn't matter. We are going there whether we want to or not. In five years, everyone who is reading these words will have an e-mail address...unless s/he is so determined a Luddite that s/he also eschews the telephone and electricity.

When we are all together in Cyberspace then we will see what the human spirit, and the basic desire to connect, can create there. I am convinced that the result will be more benign if we go there open-minded, open-hearted, excited with the adventure, than if we are dragged into exile.

And we must remember that going to Cyberspace, unlike previous great emigrations to the frontier, hardly requires us to leave where we have been. Many will find, as I have, a much richer appreciation of physical reality for having spent so much time in virtuality.

Despite its current (and perhaps, in some areas permanent insufficiencies), we should go to Cyberspace with hope. Groundless hope, like unconditional love, may be the only kind that counts.





J. Kreilsberg-Barlow interview
==============================

John Perry Barlow Interview

12/3/94

New York City

B:  It's certainly not up to me to digest the entire body of his work and regurgitate it when the essential point is something that you can say in about 15 words.

JK:  What do you think it is?

B:  That the point of all evolution to this stage is to create the collective organism of mind.   That's what Teilhard would say.  I have some other things to say in addition to that.  But that's the best way I can sum up his work.  It's about creating a consciousness so profound that it will make good company for God himself.  Or itself.

JK: Or an extension of God itself.

B:  Right.  That's how I would see it.  I don't think that's how Teilhard would see it.  He was still, with all, a monotheist and a dualist and a Catholic.  I don't have any illusions about that.  It doesn't make a bad fellow out of him.

JK:  He had some real questionable aspects.  I don't buy him whole hog. But he put his finger on some very central truths that we have to listen to.

B:  It's often the case.  It's like Newton said, "If I've seen far, I've stood on the shoulders of giants."  It's often the case that the giants cannot see.  I had a classic case of that the other night.  Do you know who Richard Dawkins is?  Do you know the idea of the meme?

JK:  No.

B:  Well, this is an idea that Dawkins threw out rather casually in a essay he wrote ten years ago which was that ideas have many of the characteristics of life forms, in their self-reproductive capacity and the way they spread.   They are rather like genetic patterns and they have a self-replicating independence in the world. This idea was one of the most powerful things I ever heard.  It made a whole lot of things make sense about the ecology of mind.   And it developed and blossomed and transmuted itself until I now look at carbon-based life as a thin film that develops on top of the real thing.

JK:  Consciousness?

B:  Invisible life.  Information.  The self-duplicating patterns of relationship.  The life forms that form in the space between things.  The non carbon-based life. The real thing.   So I thought it is going to be great to talk to Dawkins about this.  It turns out the man was a resolute reductionist who thought I was talking complete horseshit.  Not only was it just poetry, it was bad poetry.  It was a pretty frustrating experience. But it was appropriate too.

JK:  Right.  It's your job to take his idea the next step.

B:  Exactly.  It was precisely in keeping with the evolutionary model.

JK:  Right.  You get the ah-hah.

B:  And presumably somebody  else will be getting their ah-hahs off of me. And I'll find them to be full of shit.  "What are you taking about?  That's nonsense."

JK:  I like the idea of memes.

B:  It's helpful to me because I've been trying to think about the politics of cyberspace.  The enfranchisement, what does the enfranchization do?  And I increasingly think that it's not the expressor, but the idea itself. That the enfranchized entity is the idea and not the person who says it or has it.

JK:  You mean, it has a life of its own once it leaves my lips.

B:  Yes.  And it's the right of that thing to go on existing and not be suppressed and not be killed and not be imprisoned.

JK:  That's a great idea.  Because then we get away from the whole anthropocentric issue which is the big problem.  And that is much closer to Omega or God, a much closer reflection of the divine, in getting it away from the ego and the self.

B:  Right. From the flesh.  From the meat.  Which is something that the soul is wrapped in for pedagogical purposes only.

JK:  Or a stage in evolution.

B:  An important stage.  Until recently I didn't fully believe in the separability of the soul from the flesh.

JK:  In terms of life after death?

B:  Or life before life.  I was forced into this position.  I was living with somebody.  She was the first great love of my life.  And after a relatively short time of being together -- we only had a year together -- she suddenly dropped dead in April.  And I was forced to see things differently than I had before out of emotional necessity.

JK:  Do you still feel her now?

B:  Oh, absolutely.  And that opened up the conditions for a lot of things.

JK:  It's interesting, I just confronted this issue on a more philosophical level.  I just finished Frank Tipler's book.  There are some interesting ideas in there but I think most of it is hog wash.  But what he forced me to confront is the question of whether life will continue forever.  At first I thought, how can we know?  Who are we to say?  Then I thought, can I imagine a universe without life?  It's like imagining a universe without God and that is inconceivable.

B:  My sense of what life is now, I can't imagine there being anything without life in it.

JK:  Right.

B:  For me, life is simply relationship.  If there is a thing, and another thing, then there's a relationship between those two things and there is life.

JK:  My favorite theologian at the moment is someone called John Cobb who I highly recommend to you.  He comes from the process school.

B:  Which is making a major ascendancy right now.

JK:  Right.  After spending two years going through everything I could find, I ended up with Cobb.   He calls God "Life. " Which I think is a much fuller and richer term.  That is simply what God is.  It's the force of Life continuing to grow and change and push its way through the Universe. Cobb has a wonderful way of expressing both the transcendent and immanent faces of God.  The transcendent is of course way beyond us.  But the immanent is actually in process with us.  We change  God as we change.  The immanent face of God is highly mutable, while the transcendent face remains beyond.

B:  I think the transcendent face -- there are many, many spheres of the transcendent face.  One of the things that's happening now is the next sphere is becoming visible to us.  I think there are spheres all the way up.

JK: Right. Infinite spheres.  Teilhard calls this phase we are entering the third phase which I really love about  his work.  The second phase is consciousness becoming aware of itself and the third phase is evolution becoming aware of itself. So it's a collective idea of consciousness.

B:  Do you know  about the work of Tom Ray, for example?

JK: No.

B:  You should check out Tom Ray.  He is an electronic lifeist.  And he has created ecologies in computer RAM space where evolution is dramatically excellerated and he's getting all these little code life forms which are, for example, much more adept at certain programming issues than any  human being could ever write.  They simply develop in RAM.  And he is currently pushing a program to get a virtual bioreserve put on the internet for these creatures to develop in.

JK:  Is he with Santa Fe institute, with the A-life people?

B:  He is associated with Santa Fe institute.  He is currently in Japan. I just had the Grateful Dead drop 10 grand on him out of the sky to help him with his internet project.

JK:  He wants to just set up a . . . .

B:  Well, he wants a partioned area for these things to generate.

(Brings Ralph Abraham's book over -- tape pause.)

JK:  I have two copies.  Ralph sent me one and his publisher sent me one as well.  It's terrific, I really like it.  I just got his Web book too.  It's great.

B:  Yes.  It's a little odd that the great Ralph Abraham would be writing a Web guide.

JK:  A primer.  I know.  He is the most wonderful person.

B:  He is a true angel.

JK:  Yes.  He has a very angelic energy.    OK, let's talk a little about Teilhard, even though I can tell that we want to talk about a lot of things, this stuff being my obsession as well as yours.

B:  There's a group of us who went up the same saucer.   That's the only explanation I have for it.  I mean, I run into these people once in a while, not often, and you are obviously one of them, who have the same odd religion I do.  And it's quite granular, quite particular.  It has all these odd little elements that one could never have gotten from the culture.  And it's like we're all down in the basement making replicas of Devil's Tower and not knowing why we want to do that.

JK:  I know.

B:  But Teilhard is certainly an element.  I haven't run across many people who have this religion who haven't read Teilhard. But it's not a causal element.  It's just another one of the elements.

JK:  It's a piece you come across.  It's, "Oh, this fits in."  But it's not everything.  There are some pieces here, but, oh, there are some pieces over here. . . .

B:  Right. You know about the Noetics people, the Noetics Institute.

JK:  In Marin.

(Pause)

JK:  My first step in trying to articulate this odd vision is to write a piece for WIRED about Teilhard.  And my challenge there is to make Teilhard relevant to the readers of WIRED.

B:  I've been meaning to do this, so I'm glad you are.

JK:  I knew had to talk to you about this.  That was obvious from the beginning.

B:  Did I send you that thing that I wrote for ACM about Teilhard and The Great Work?

JK:  Yes.  What I've read is the piece in the Journal.  Were you pleased with that?  I though it was a nice piece.

B:  It was OK.  I liked the picture better.  I had a good time doing the picture.

JK:  I bet.  The part I liked best was your quote about fire and the picture mirrored that.  And then I read the piece in the Wesleyan magazine, which arrived in our house because my husband went to Wesleyan.

B:  When did he go to Wesleyan?

JK:  Oh, he graduated in '81.  But that's what made me realize I should get in touch with you.  But in all the pieces, the idea of the Great Work emerged.  So why don't you talk a little about what you mean be that.

B:  Well, there's something a little misleading about the phrase.  Because the original use of the phrase that I was thinking of was the Gothic cathedrals which were referred to in their time as being the Great Work. And I looked at the net as being the Great Work of the present.  You know, the highest expression of the culture of this era.  And that was before I really started to think about invisible life in the way that I do now. Starting to re-relate Teilhard to this.  At a certain point is suddenly dawned on me, I had a very crystalline perception, that this was precisely what he had been talking about.

JK:  Invisible life?

B:  No, the net.  The net was precisely what he had been talking about. Which was pretty prescient, when you consider what he had to look at the time.   But he was an evolutionist , which helped, so he was little better able to see what the next several layers were liable to look like. Ontogony recapitulates philogony, in both directions.  So he had an advantage. But it is a little uncanny that he says it so clearly. But I hadn't thought about Teilhard much since college when some aspect of the psychedelic experience illuminated the continuity of mind.  And I had also read Bateson and had a similar resonance.  As had a number of other people.  Ralph Abraham had the same thing.  These was some combination of the right literature and the right antecedent experiences and LSD that became like the crystal that got dropped in the supersaturated solution. But then I went off to Wyoming and spent 17 years pushing cows around and thinking about it.  I was pretty abstracted from what it going on out here in the world.  I was trying to make myself as much a part of the 19th century as I could make myself.  The 20th seemed to be unremittingly beastly.  But suddenly I realized I could switch seamlessly to the 21st and skip the whole thing.  Suddenly it just came back to me.  I think it was the first time I telnetted someplace and realized it was all one thing.  It was all continuous, it was all simultaneously present.  And that blew my mind.  I mean, telnetting for the first time was a genuinely religious experience.

JK:  You mean, you had a mystical vision. . . .

B:  Right.  Wow, I'm over here.

JK:  Yes.  I, I am over here.

B:  Exactly.  And then of course, one falls back from all ones epiphanies to more conventional experience.

JK:  Damn, back here again.

B:  Right.  On the other hand, we're just telnetting and furthermore, I can't get into the damn computer.  I think Teilhard would agree with this, that human beings are divinely endowed with something which is a kind of holy disatisfaction which sets us apart from all other beings on the planet.  There is no satisfying a human.  There is always in itch that cannot be scratched.  Everything else adapts to its surroundings.  We adapt our surroundings to us and we still aren't happy.  And that unhappiness is our most singular characteristic as a species and also our glory.  They ought to call us homo-disatisfactus.  And it fuels a lot of our creative endeavor.  And I'm now starting to think that what that  unhappiness really is is the internal surge of invisible life within us trying to break free of the flesh altogether.  And be out there so it can really live.

JK:  And is that related to Omega?

B:  Oh, I think it's on the road to Omega.  It's along the line.  I have this funny kind of paradoxical teleology that says that as long as you are in the physical world, teleology makes sense because you have entropy and the apparent directional flow of time.  But I'm increasingly aware of how irrelevant those things are on the fairly thin membrane that separates us from eternity.   And, you know, on the other side of that membrane, Omega is continuous.

JK:  Right.  But there's an issue here because clearly technology is leading us away from our bodies.  It's a disembodied state, it's a state of consciousness.  But how does that affect our sacred relationship to the sacred earth.  That's the conundrum I keep coming back to.

B:  Well, mine is actually enhanced in a peculiar way.  I am more devotedly attached to the physical world than I even have been.  I am more tactile, more passionately so.  I am much more interested in experience than information.  And the best thing about this is that in enables me to have much more experience all around the world than I had before.  Here's another paradox.  My original thought was that because of cyberspace I was going to be able to plunk myself down in Pinedale, Wyoming and my mind could roam the plant.  Precisely the opposite has happened.  My body is roaming the planet and my mind is plunked down at barlow@eff.org where people can find me all the time.

JK:  I love paradox.

B:  Well, it's a good thing you do because it's another piece of this funny religion.

JK:  Yes.  Paradox is the key to all truth.

B:  Absolutely.  If I'm not in the presence of paradox, I assume I'm in the presence of something that somebody made up.

JK:  Yes.  Ken Wilber said it beautifully.

B:  Wilber is important.

JK:  Right.  He said paradox is the way God looks to the intellect.  And that's all it is.

B: Neils Bohr had another way of saying it that I always liked.  "The opposite of a trivial truth is false, the opposite of a great truth is also true."

JK:  That's great.  I like that a lot.  Maybe that's why I keep coming back to this body issue, because it is paradoxical but it gets synthesized in our own personal experience.

B:  And it's also, at which level are you observing this?  What slice are you taking here?  Another one of my experiences that really led me here was I was giving a talk on VR at NYU about a year ago.  And, inevitably you always get a question about sex, right away.  Which I always thought was just a bothersome reality as I said in response to this question.  This is so bizaare, because nothing could be less sexy than VR.  It's like having had your body amputated.

JK:  Right, images of full body gloves and everything.

B:  Right.  You want to take that shit off.  But this fairly corporeal woman in the front row suddenly said, "But don't you think with regard to sex, your body is just a prosthesis anyway?"  And I said, "For what?"  And she said, "Well, that's the question isn't it?"  And I just has a shiver. I thought, whoa!  I don't know who you are but you are absolutely right about this.

JK:  That's a very feminine perspective, by the way.  The woman's experience tends to be much more transcendent.

B:  It actually changed my experience.  It became a much more spiritual thing to me after that.

JK:  I like that.  Part of me, I don't know.

B:  She's right though.  But not.  But it enabled me to suddenly understand why there was this fascination with sex and VR because sex is involved in bringing invisible life into materiality.  And so you'd assume that as the flesh becomes word again, that sex would be involved.

JK:  And sex is the passion, the Eros.

B:  Right.  And you'd expect to see some on the other side.  So suddenly it made sense.

JK:  So, when you say invisible life is trying to break free -- I really like that idea a lot.  That invisible life that is happening, that is beginning to form now, is that the same life?

B:  I don't see that there is much difference.  It's a matter of medium. And there are many media.  For example, there is the medium of mathematics where you find something like the Mandlebrot set, which is a feature of the universe which is as real as Mt. Everest but that was previously invisible to us.  Until we had something with which to essentially photograph that reality.  And there are many other media that we will never know because we are too bound up, our perceptions are physically contained.  But if you think about the RNA/DNA interchange.  The arrangement of nucleotides along the DNA molecule, what's important there is the agency that stacks those proteins in the order they are.   The proteins are kind of irrelevant, it's the pattern of information that's relevant.  You see what I mean.

JK:  Yes, it's not the 0s and the 1s.   It's the pattern . . .

B:  It's the space between the 0s and the 1s.  This is what Leibniz knew. He wrote a letter to the Emperor of China proving in his view the necessity of dualism based on the fact that he invented binary math.  He said I have proven that all you need is a 0 and a 1 and you can create the entire universe, so obviously the universe is dualistic.  And the Emperor of China wrote back and said, what you tell me is like the Tao which is all one.

JK:  That's great.  That's why I had a hard time with Tipler.  What he does is he takes quantum cosmology and extends it to the transpersonal realm. He does what Wilber would call a pre/trans fallacy.   He uses prepersonal experience to describe transpersonal reality.    And it falls apart for that reason.

B:  I think that the internal workings of quantum mechanics are literally inaccessible to mind.  It's one of those portholes that you can't see very much through.  I find chaos theory a lot more fruitful because it involves things of the phenomenal world that I can experience.  The pattern of unseen order which manifests itself in seen order.

JK:  With quantum, if you have a mystical sensibility it's utterly seductive because it has the many worlds theorem, has things coming in and out of material reality . . . .

B:  Yes, I started out as a physics major for this very reason.  I went to Wesleyan with the idea that I was going to study physics, with a religious objective.  And decided that it wasn't going to get me far enough.

JK:  Right.  It's the seduction that doesn't have the pay off.

B:  It didn't for me anyway.  Maybe it did for Neils Bohr, and Schroedinger.

JK:  You have to be careful, because it's not a mirror.  It's using the first level to see the 100th level, all you see is the first level of the 100th level.  It's not the whole 100th level.

(END OF SIDE 1)

B:  I really want to find a way to get this stuff out there, because I have a feeling that there are a lot of us who don't know that they are.

JK:  I agree.  And it would be one of those things like when the Goddess literature started coming out in the 80s and all these people said, "That's it."  I see it as a very similar kind of evolutionary moment.

B:  It's actually related.  Strongly related.

JK:  Yes.  I've been practicing Wicca for 15 years, so I see that as part of it, definitely.

B:  Part of what happened to me, maybe it's partly from having three daughters, but I became a pretty devout feminist, which, coming from a cattl e ranch in Wyoming, it was a little latent.

JK:  I'm one of three girls too, so I can relate to that.

(Tape pause.)

JK:  I want to get some good juicy quotes out of you about Teilhard.  In terms of the role of orthogenesis, which I love, to me it's one of those simple and clear truths that as things become more complex, consciousness grows.  What is cyberspace doing to further that?

B:  Well, you are getting past the mechanical barrier.  The problem with the Age of Reason, which was not a problem for a long time.  Reason and science are incredibly useful tools, they endow you with the ability to create very basic systems and structures.  Both understanding it and so on. And we have now reached a level of complexity in the mechanical structures we have built using the tools of analysis and reason that is up against the limit of what those tools can continue to provide. In fact, it has exceeded it.

JK:  Philosophical tools?

B:  Philosophical and literal.

JK:  Mechanical.

B:  Yes.  (Tape garble) to develop creatures instead of tools.  Because we now have software problems that are beyond the ability of any software designer to figure out.  On the other hand, we can now think about growing code.  There is a fellow who is selling an optical character reader where he is training his little programlette objects to eat Rs or eat Ss or eat Ts and they're voracious.

JK:  They never get full or tired.

B:  Exactly.  It appeals to me because it has a kind of agricultural quality to it.  The notion of stewardship.  Taking care of life forms and they are taking care of you.  You are not looking at it as this is my hammer and this is my nail.

JK:  So, they're not over and against us.  They're with us and an extension of.  This is an important distinction because people get flipped out, they get scared.  It's HAL.

B:  Well, they could be threatening but not for the reasons they think. The reason they should be scared is that their grandchildren will probably be unrecognizable to them as even human.

JK:  What do you mean by that?  What is your vision.

B:  I think that very rapidly human consciousness is going to change to a much more explicit awareness of the continuity of mind.   They are going to see that the apparent idea that you've got your mind and I've got mine is nonsense.  That you have your thoughts and I have mine is ridiculous.  It absolutely is.  Mind is absolutely continuous.  It's bodies that aren't continuous.  And if you actually start thinking about all the invisible life between bodies than you can see how continuous they are as well.  It's just that it's not visible to you.  So I think that after a couple of generations on the net what one thinks will not be what one thinks.   There will not be "one thinking. "

JK:  If you start imagining what that next phase of evolution actually looks like, what it feels like, with evolution being aware of itself, with the noosphere being a palpable force. . .

B:  There are also other feedback loops that are going to be brought into play.  We are now  very close to this point.  You can give somebody a virus which recodes their entire genetic code and reforms their bodies.   This is now primarily being thought of in terms of genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia.  But, you know, given the fact that people are willing to pay $20,000 for a set of breasts that they like, what are they going to do for 20 IQ points?  So information technology is going to come back into the body and I don't think it will take very long to start changing the physical human pretty dramatically.   You know, and there's also this accelerating projectile of history that you can feel at the moment, that it is logarithmically increasing like processor speed, or net population.

JK:  It feels way out of our control.

B:  Way  out of our control.  Totally.  It's to the point where I'm just patiently amused by these people who think that we have to do something about technology.

JK:  Right, like what do you propose . . . ?

B:  Yeah, let's talk to the person who's in charge.  Give me his phone number, I'll call him.

JK:  But that whole knowledge set is still there.  That's why I think a book has to get out there that talks about technology as a central part of the Goddess culture and the environmental culture and all the rest because they all tend to think of technology as the bad guy.  It's a pretty serious problem.

B:  It's just another layer of immune response.  Much of what the universe is about is defining self against the other.  And that's true all over the material plane and equally true on the invisible.

JK:  Yes.  All these global outbreaks of nationalism seem to me to be such a clear response to technology.  Once you see it this way, these things are so simple.

B:  And irrelevant.  Oh, that's part of that.

JK:  Yes.  And politics.  People ask are you a democrat or a republican?  I agree with conservative republicans on some issues and liberal democrats on others.

B:  The only dichotomy that makes sense there is authoritarianism versus libertarianism.  And they're evenly distributed across what appears to be the political spectrum.   There are all these liberal democrats in the White House who are as authoritarian as they can possibly be.

JK:  That's why they are having such a hard time right now.

B:  Authoritarianism is about to get a long overdue payoff.  They are about to get hammered.   Unfortunately, they are going to hammer us in the process.  As the last election had proven, they are going to take this in a dyspeptic way.

JK: There will be some fallout.

B:  And I would expect there to be some.  Because what we are really talking about here is a paradigm shift from monotheism to pantheism.

JK:  The shift from the atomic metaphor to the neural net metaphor.

B:  It's the hierarchy with God in his heaven and depravity on earth getting completely squished.

JK:  The technical term is panentheism.  Which is what Teilhard is.  Which is the holographic model.

B:  The evenly distributed God.

JK: Right.  It's the immanent and the transcendent together.  Process theologians are panentheists.  Teilhard is.  It means anyone who sees both the immanent and the transcendent face of God.  Pantheists tend to only see the immanent side of God, while the monotheists tend to only see the transcendent side.  The panentheists see both.

B:  God is a verb is the way I see it.

JK:  Yes.  That's why "Life" is such a wonderful word for God.

B:  In fact, not only is God a verb.  So is everything else.

JK:  I'm interested in what you were saying a few thoughts ago about the breakdown of the individual and the coming into oneness because I think that's one of the other ideas that I really like.  He calls Omega the Hyper-personal.  So it's in the greatest unity that we find our greatest individuality.  It's not that we leave our individualism behind, we have it right alongside absolute unity.  It's the full expression of the paradox.

B:  Right.  It's not going to be like "We".  Did you read that?  About a society that it utterly collectivized.   It's an interesting book, I recommend it.  Zamyatin.

JK:  I think the idea of the Hyper-personal as something that we are moving towards is important.  I find that on the net.  It's when people are most themselves that we find the greatest community.

B:  Which is precisely what you would expect because in ecology the greatest source of strength is diversity.  Monocultures are not robust at all.  So you would expect that to be true in other ecologies as well, which is what this is.  Culturally I find this to be the case as well.  As I travel more and more and I'm not spending so much time in Pinedale, Wyoming I have a much greater appreciation for what the total globe is, the entire human experience, which endows me with a much greater appreciation of my own little Wyoming version of it.  Or the New York version of it.

JK:  You are more who you were when you start with after going everywhere.

B: That's an old story..

JK:  The Aeneid.

B:  Right.  That's the first question Odysseus asks is what man knows his father?  Well, the paradoxical answer is that you are looking at him in the mirror.  Your father is the sum of you and all you experience.   But to get back to Teilhard.

JK:  This is another Omega question.  For Teilhard the essential energy of Omega is love.  That's the glue.   And I think that's true.

B:  Indisputably.  If you strip away all the illusory stuff and get down to it, that's what it is.  Or some combination of what we would call love and faith.

JK:  What about reason?

B:  Reason is the enemy of both faith and love.  Faith is the groundless hope that any organism has to try and eject itself into the possibility space.  It's the thing that accounts for the distribution of life.  Why are there species on islands 1,000 miles from the nearest land.  What drove their antecedents to come there?  It was an act of faith.  Involuntary in some cases.

JK:  So how do you see that manifesting in cyberspace now?   It's a very intellectual place.

B:  Yes, but it isn't.  It's constantly wishing to be something else.  When my lover died, I got probably a megabyte of email from all over the planet from people I didn't know saying extraordinary things, truly extraordinary. Very helpful.  And demonstrating a lot of love of a very pure sort.  We didn't even know each other, we are never going to meet, but there was just something about the story that touched them.

JK:  So that helps to build the love balance in the universe.  There is the ability to communicate more of it.

B: Right.  Well, what is love?  Love is that which connects.  That which desires to connect for reasons not know to itself.  Just as sin, in Neitsche's view, is that which separates.  It's very simple.

JK:  So cyberspace offers an architecture for love.

B:  Ultimately.  But of course, there is as much separation being bred as connection.  You would expect that.  It's necessary I think.

JK:  Well, that's part of it too.

B:  Yes.  I feel these disturbing manifestations, such as people spending 70 hours a week staring into glass tubes, trying to contact other human beings.  When all they have to do is walk out in the street.  But it's a major step past sitting there and watching another kind of glass tube which comes at you and offers no communication or connection whatsoever.  We have to have this glass tube phase.

JK:  Yes.  But I was very gratified when I contacted you and you said "highest bandwidth please."  I thought, Yes.  That is the key.  To have this supplement to enable meeting people.

B:  It enabled us to get together without having a whole lot of difficulty attached to it.  Given the way I move around, if I hadn't gotten this it wouldn't have been possible.

JK: Right.  But this is still in interim phase.  Where do you see it going?

B:  Well, I think bandwidth is going to increase in ways that we can't begin to imagine.  And the penetration of bandwidth into human neurology is going to increase in ways we cannot being to conceive.

JK:  So we will get direct plugged in?

B:  Not necessarily physically,  but it will become increasingly easy to understand, for example, what is the neurological firing pattern of an emotion?  And we can begin to get that pattern to fire directly without the intermediary  steps.  So if I think Mozart, you hear it.

JK:  Which is a potential we have had all along.

B:  And this is not a far-fetched notion.  I can see the line from here to there pretty clearly.

JK:  We already receive a huge amount of invisible information.

B:  Oh, yeah.  Huge.

JK:  It's just learning how to do that in a more direct way.

B:  So that's a big part of it, I think.  I'm sure we're going to have some very clumsy stuff in the middle.  And I'm not positive if bandwidth is the answer because there is another holy question that hasn't been properly dealt with and it is one of my side obsessions.  I'll tell you the experience where this happened.  I was at XeroxParc with a guy named Ronjit Macooney (?) who is a diminutive Hindu fellow  who did something a few years ago which was just brilliant called the electric thanka.  He knew that one of the important dimensions of Tibetan thanka is the time element. They  are not static, they are something that moves over time, but that isn't an aspect that Westerners see very well and he knew that multimedia made it possible to show a Westerner as it was and adapt it.  But he was working on a room at XeroxParc and another room at ParcPortland which was supposed to be a virtual conferencing area where, really good video and great sound reproduction and lots of screens and lots of cameras and in essence you could kind of get a sense of the other person's presence in the room, where they were in relation to the other person, what their body language was, what their tonality was.  Pretty damn close to being there. But I said, "Well Ranjit, does this thing work?"  And he said, "Oh, no."And I said, "Well, what's missing?"  And he said, "The prana."  So that's the central question.  Can the prana get through the wire?

JK:  The way I phrase that question is can information be transpersonal? Is information transpersonal? \[I think this is a slightly different question.  This whole issue about information and its levels has to be much more carefully worked out.\]

B:  You know, there are two levels of information.  There is the information which is ultimately God or Life.  And then there's this other stuff which is about something and is really just alienated experience, and very thin, highly compressed form of experience.  So you say, "chair" and type it in there and I read it on my screen and I think I know "chair" but I don't really  know beans about the chair.  Because the experience of the chair which you have taken and compressed down into a portable format to get into my head is such a lossy compression scheme that all the important stuff has been stripped away from it.

JK:  And that's about 90% of what goes on.

B:  And if you think about it, the history of humanity, most of our history was spent recognizing the futility of trying to communicate this way.  I mean, we use language for discussing that which was present that we were experiencing, or discussing that which was never present and would never be experienced in this sense.  It was about, you know, religious stuff.  After Gutenberg, something happened.  Ship it over here and tell you about this chair that you never will see.  So that you think you know.  And this is like the great lie of the last thousand years which is about to come to an end I think.  And the point is to re-experientialize information.   To give you the ability that you have in an experience even though you are not there.  And that ability is for every cell in your body  to ask questions about the environment.

JK:  And that's where VR comes in.

B:  Right.

JK:  Back to Wilber.   I always find Wilber so useful when you get confused about terms and where they are falling.  Because information also has its levels of experience.  It's prepersonal and its personal and it has its transpersonal aspects. And what is happening mostly on the net right now is intellectual and emotional information.  And the transpersonal is still kind of beyond.  And what we are talking about it helping the net to evolve further so that it is bigger and has room for transpersonal experience. And that has to do with bandwidth.  It has to do with experience.  It has to do with intentionality of the people on the net.

B:  Well, there are all these secret traps.  I had this love affair on the net which was almost entirely virtual due to the fact that it was illicit. She and I could not communicate at all, we couldn't even talk on the phone because she was working with her husband and was never more than about 8 feet away from him.  It was incredibly intense.  150,000 words of email in close to 6 months.  What I started to realize is that every time I would see her she would be even further away.  What I realized is that we were each taking the spaces between the words and filling them with our own narcissistic projections of ourselves.

JK:  Which is what we do in most romances anyway.

B:  But this was worse.  Much worse.  And far more separating than anything like that than I've ever done before.  And now I know.  I am aware of that pitfall.  And there are millions in there not to know  yet.

JK:  Damn it takes so much consciousness to figure this stuff out.

B:  Well, you're always at your own part of the course of study.  That's what I believe a lot of physical manifestation is.

JK:  We all have our own baggage of karma that we carry with us.

B:  We have this western notion of karma which is really just Calvinism.

JK:  You were bad, so you will suffer.

B:  Wrong.  It's exactly opposite.  If you see someone who is really suffering you should do homage to them.  They are learning.  I had this experience years ago with this guy I picked up outside Fallen, Nevada. Terrible place.  Nothing between there and Salt Lake City  except two-lane blacktop.  The guy was sitting on the edge of town with a sign that said, "Anywhere but here."

JK:  How could you resist?

B:  I was hoping he wasn't too bad because we were going to spend most of the night together.  And he got in the car and he was a wreck, but I immediately felt this incredible sense of peace and goodwill emanating from this fellow.  And it turned out that among other things he was born, literally, a day after I was.   And he had had a very different kind of life -- he'd gone to Vietnam and got shot up and come back kindof twisted up in the head, had been living in NY on a VA disability payment, but he also had a job, and was driving a cab and he had a musical gig and a girlfriend -- he had a life.  He got into a dispute with his landlord and said he wasn't going to pay the rent until his landlord did something. Well, he didn't pay the rent and landlord locked up all his stuff and wouldn't let him into his apartment and informed the VA that he'd died. The VA believed it.  This guy had no identification whatsoever and blam, he'd down beneath the cracks.  Just like that.  With no way to get back up. And he had a very literal kind of religious faith.  At one point I said, "I don't get it.  You've got this very strong sense of faith and yet if things are set up the way you think they are then God is mistreating you. And I don't believe in God, not the way you do anyway and, I'm doing fine."He said, "The way I see it you are taking basket-weaving and I'm taking Astrophysics 406.  And I would expect it to be easier for you."   He had this lovely way of preaching, about the most modest form of it that  I've ever heard.  He would write these little things about love and put them in the coin return slots in phone booths.

JK:  But it's true.  I know in my own life that it's the hardest times that make the most difference.

(END OF TAPE 1)

TAPE 2

B:  EFF is something that is kindof co-evolutionary between me and Mitch and the other people that are attached to it.  It's constantly fluid and changing.  There was a period when what we thought was important was  to make sure that the information superhighway, which was roaring into cyberspace from the right, would be able to be an interoperable and useful part for the gathering of the Great Work.  And we spent a bunch of time in Congress trying to develop set-top box standards and all that kind of stuff.  Actually, over the last six months Mitch and I have realized that it is all based on a paradigm that is so clumsy  and slow --  regulatory, monopolistic, big science, big industry, big every goddamned thing. Basically, this is precisely the wrong way to approach the construction of cyberspace.   The net is doing a fine job in a completely unregulated fast, loose and out of control way.  It has a participating link with the existing structure.  Somebody has to string all that fiber optic cable. I'm supposed to go out and debate John Malone on Monday and the big question I have is whether I am going to try and convince him that he is on a fool's errand.

JK:   Building this infrastructure?

B:  Which he thinks he's going to make a lot of money  on.  I think he's going eventually go belly up.

JK:  Yes, but someone has to lay the wires so maybe you shouldn't let him in on the secret.

B:  That's exactly right.  I doubt that I'm going to have much of an effect on him anyway, but you never know.

JK:  But it's true that once it gets laid it's going to be a free for all.

B:  It's like Gibson (?) said, the street finds its own uses for things.

JK:  I believe that.  One interesting aspect of this cosmology is that it also gives you a window into business patterns.  You begin with the perspective that the forces of life and evolution tend to go in a certain direction and from there you can make an excellent educated guess.

B:  Probably.  But sometimes you can get off too, because your timescale isn't right.  For example, I wouldn't have predicted Microsoft, but I wasn't looking at the size of the system.  Microsoft is analogous to the great red spot on Jupiter -- it's one of these cyclonic disturbances that is participating in such a large system that it can stay in tact for a long time.  I think Microsoft is going to look ridiculous in five years.

JK:  It's going to do what IBM did?

B:  That's right.

JK:  You're right.  The evolutionary path is so complex, you never know when the antitheses are coming in.

B:  You get into connection crash.  Too much information.  That's what is happening to the government of the Unites States.  Government at that level is collapsing, whereas at another higher up, its still removed enough from the ground that it can operate at a metaphorical plane and not go into connection crash.  And down at the tribal level, it can do fine.

JK:  What do you think about educating the next generation.  Do your daughters have computers?

B:  Yes.  I've tried to make computers part of the furniture the same way guns were for me growing up.  The more important part of their education for me is. . . .  Well, let me give you an example.  We were in Hawaii for a while and in Hawaii there were big bugs, big, scary bugs.  Centipedes and stuff.  I managed to convince them that they were vertabratists.   They would find racism to be a pretty untenable position.  Well, vertabratism wasn't much better.  And now I'm trying to convince them that they are meatists, that they are probably intolerant of invisible life.  That's the kind of education I'm trying to give them.  It's more of an awareness of the wholeness of things.  And I'm not putting too much emphasis on computers.

JK:  Do you find that the next generation is interested in technology.  Or are we just a weird blip?

B:  No, no.  The seventh cavalry has arrived just in time.

JK:  Which is?

B:  Kids raised by hippies.  I worried about it.  In the middle of the social experiment, I worried.  I thought, these kids could grow up like our dogs and our dogs where nothing to be proud of.   Go to a place like Breckenridge in 1973 and they were running around like wolf packs.  But in fact, there's a whole group of people who are 24 and under now who are just wonderful.  They are so sweet and so affectionate to one another and so tolerant and open and have such a wonderful sense of humor.  I am endlessly encouraged by them.  I spend a lot of time with them.  I am fortunate in that I am a mildly heroic figure in that culture.

JK:  And they are not Technophobes?

B:  Not at all.   They are into it.  They are websters.

JK:  So, it's going to happen naturally.   We don't have to worry about getting computers in schools and access and all that.

B:  That is the old way of thinking.  It's control thinking.  All you really have to do is worry about how you are.   That's really the only constructive thing you can do, I think, is to manifest yourself in as resonative a way as you can.  And that's why when I go out and talk, I don't feel like I'm saying things that people have to write down on paper. I'm being somebody that has an effect on them that they are not even aware of.

JK:  That's how I feel about books too.   I know  that when I read a book, if I get one good idea out of it, it's worth it.  That one good idea kicks off another 100.

B:  That's what Borges said.  Some people write novels and I write short stories.  And in fact, people read those novels and they get short stories out of them, so why bother with all the other stuff?

JK:  Most novels should be short stories.  OK.  So, you're not disturbed by the fact that we're going to leave our bodies?  I always come back to that.

B:  Well, I think we are going to rediscover our bodies as they really are.

JK:  Which is part of a holographic system.  So the cells start to transmit consciouness in a way.  They become wholly alive, like Jesus's resurrection body.

B:  Right.  Like the mystical body.

JK:  Which is flesh.  St. Paul said, that is flesh.

B:  Exactly, so this mystical body, in addition to being flesh, is fiber optic,  electricity, airline fuselages. . . .

JK:  That's a great image.  On one of my on-line groups, we were having a discussion about duality, about bodies.  And one of the participants, who is a hermeticist, was dealing with the question very elementally -- earth, air, water, fire.  And he talked about the idea of a transposed earth. Thinking about it not as clods of dirt earth, but as the earth element present in all layers of reality.  The elemental quality comes with us as we mutate.

B:  The other great binary process besides self versus other is what Hereclitus referred to an an antiodroma.  The inevitability of things becoming their opposite.

JK:  Yes.  I've used that idea quite a bit.  That's one of the important ideas about technology which is the ultimate linear medium.  But it ultimately gets pushed so far that it becomes the hologram.

B:  It's a difference in degree which becomes a difference in kind.   And that's a lot of what Ralph is hip to.  The dynamic shift point, when turbulence becomes order.  When the linear flow becomes chaotic.

JK:  But these others folks are seeing that order becomes turbulence but also that turbulence also becomes order again.    So it's a constant movement through all the cycles.

B:  Which is just what you or I would expect.  But not what the government would expect.

JK:  But Clinton is a smart guy.  He just doesn't get it?

B:  In August, just after the election, Mitch and I went down there.  We were all excited, we were going to go to the White House.  And they said, "What do you want to do?" And we said,  "Well, we want to help out with whatever you want to do."  And they said, "We don't know what we want to do."  And I looked at Mitch and I said, "Where's Dad?"  And he said, "I guess we're Dad."  But the comforting realization was that no one had ever really known what to do.  And it had been going on in this emergent way anyway.  We had had this Prussian model and Italian method all along.  It wasn't that there was some hard mechanical relationship between the lighthouse and the rudder.  And the Republicans are about to have a hard lesson.  Short of doing something brutal, which they may try, they don't have any way of bringing across any of the things they want to get done.

JK:  The issue here is that everything is so complex, that you can't understand it.

B:  But if you are still part of that control mania, if you are part of the psychotic dregs of monotheism, then the solution to everything is a bigger hammer.  So the war on drugs has failed.  What's the answer?  Don't abandon it.  No, even though that works everywhere that it's been tried.   No. Just put more people in jail.  OK, you got any more questions?

JK:  No.  I think I have enough for now.  Thanks a lot.





Jack In, Young Pioneer!

Keynote Essay for the 1994 Computerworld College Edition

by John Perry Barlow

I'm entering these characters aboard the M.V. Matanuska, an Alaskan ferry headed up the Inside Passage, south of Juneau. The fog is so dense that the bow is not visible from the bridge. Morning sunlight pouring in from the top of it illuminates the whole into a blazing haze of featureless glory and peril. The Future.

Almost exactly a century ago, such fog banks were stuffed with stampeders of the last great gold rush on this continent. The flood of raw hopefuls who headed to the Yukon in 1898 were nearly the last Americans to heed the advice of the great newspaper publisher and windbag Horace Greeley, who proclaimed what was probably the motto of the 19th Century when he exhorted: "Go west, young man!"

By that time, the Yukon and Alaska were about as far west as they could go. Already every other North American frontier had been scribbled over with the graffiti of civilization.

Only a few years before, in 1875, my own family...a restless gene which had been farming recently cleared ground since the 1600's...moved into the upper reaches of the Green River Basin of Wyoming and thus deflowered the only frontier available to them without doing something as crazy as heading for the Arctic. There they came to a bewildered halt.

So I grew up resenting that the noble, essentially human, act of plunging off into unassayed wilderness, driven by nothing more rational than vague dissatisfaction and aspiration, would not be mine to undertake. It was the critical part of my inheritance which my forbears had spent.

It turns out I was not quite right about that. Today another frontier yawns before us, far more fog-obscured and inscrutable in its opportunities than the Yukon. It consists not of unmapped physical space in which to assert one's ambitious body, but unmappable, infinitely expansible cerebral space. Cyberspace. And we are all going there whether we want to or not.

We must seek our future in the virtual world because there is no economic room left in the physical one. Not only has all the good farmland been homesteaded long since, but nearly all the work one might do with his or her hands is now being done either by machines or by people from parts of the world where what's considered a living wage is a lot less than you'd likely accept.

So the engines of history have other plans for us. Save a few Amish and survivalists, we have all been swallowed by the cultural superorganism of digital technology, a beast now well beyond anyone's control, and it is slouching off to Cyberspace with us in its belly. Since it's inevitable, I would suggest we make peace with our fate, rather as though we were Jonah setting up a permanent settlement inside the whale.

I did try my personal best to resist conscription as a Knowledge Worker. I spent 17 years running the family ranch in Wyoming before I came to this. I fed cattle every winter morning from a hay sled drawn by four Belgian workhorses. I lived horseback, without lawyers or locks. I made my living from things I could touch, and far too usually smell, very much a creature of the physical world.

But I was as culturally doomed as the Tasaday of New Guinea. Technology had so empowered my competitors with fertilizer, growth hormones, and computerized futures hedging programs, that only a few of us were necessary to feed those remaining Americans who still eat beef. Such atavistic practices as mine were like stone axes against smart bombs.

Yanked from the 19th Century, I found myself, like you, tossed unceremoniously onto the doorstep of the 21st.

So here we are, plunging through the fog, unsure of where we're headed but making excellent time. While I may have serious doubts about being forced to emigrate to a place where I can't even bring my body, I can no longer complain about belonging to the first generation in the recorded history of my family to be done out of a frontier to fling itself into.

This frontier, the Virtual World, offers opportunities and perils like no other before it. Entering it, we are engaging what will likely prove the most transforming technological event since the capture of fire. I have a terrible feeling that your children, by the time they are my age, would be barely recognizable to me as human, so permanently jacked in to The Great Mind will they be.

I could be wrong about this, of course. Sweeping predictions about the future have a way of turning their authors into fools after a few decades. Our envisioned trajectories usually turn out to be a lot more fractal than plotted. The Big Events are never seen in advance.

A few days ago, I passed through Seattle, a place I first visited on the occasion of the 1961 Seattle World's Fair, which also called itself the Century 21 Expo. The Fair was filled with depictions of Seattle at the Millennium, a place where the Space Needle would be more the architectural norm than the quaint artifact it seems today.  The chief feature of these projections was a glistening transportation web from Vancouver to Portland around which the citizens would be whisked in 200 mph automatic pods. The only prediction of these which came true was that the Burbs would metastasize the full circumference of Puget Sound.

Absolutely nobody predicted the extent to which little beige bit-spitting boxes would become the substrate of civilization in the 90's.  Certainly no one foresaw that the mysterious stuff which lived in those boxes and made them spit their bits would become the economic staple of SeattlePlex. And, even in an event which  Bill Gates' prominent Seattle parents surely must have taken a hand in, no one came close to predicting such a thing as Bill Gates.

So, although we should be humble in our projections, and while the present moment is probably weirder than any previous, there are a few things which we can learn from previous frontier settlement.

At the moment it seems that the most important of these is that government will come. Such combinations of unpredictability, massive change, peril, and opportunity as are found on any frontier are to government like blood to a great white shark. This is because government lives in part to diminish unpredictability. The kind of economic free-for-all which smells like opportunity to the freebooter represents another kind of opportunity for the bureaucrat. And over the long run, it has traditionally been the bureaucrat who prevailed.

Thus, if one goes to the Yukon today, he finds very few gold miners (or, for that matter, entrepreneurs of any sort). About seventy percent of the people who are in that economically stagnant region work for some form of government. Most of them are the spiritual descendents of Sgt. Preston, whose real-life Mounty counterparts were dispatched into the economic wilds of Dawson and Skagway to impose social decency on the stampeders.

There is a cycle of frontier inhabitation which has usually gone like this: Misfits and dreamers, rejected by or rejecting society, are pushed out into the margins. There they set up camp and maintain what little order they want in it by unwritten codes, the honor of thieves, the Code of the West.

Despite their usual haplessness, they discover resources and start exploiting them. Burghers and boosters back in the civilized regions hear of these discoveries. Settlers, a milder sort, come in with their women and children and are repelled by the savagery and license of their predecessors, whether mountain men, prospectors, or Indians. They send for troops to secure the frontier for the Rotary Club and the PTA. They elect representatives, pass laws, and, pretty soon, they've created another place which is boring but which at least appears predictable.

Already we can find the usual Christian soldiers massing at the borders of Cyberspace. Whether their instruments of entry are the FBI's Digital Telephony proposal (which proposes to hard-wire the Net for automated surveillance) or the NSA's Clipper Chip (which would allow you to lock your digital door, but only if the government kept a key) or well-meaning legislative efforts ensure equal access to the Net, or increasingly punitive props in the collapsing structure of copyright law, or pure, blue-nosed priggishness, the government is preparing to place this new frontier under the rule of law. Whether the pioneers already there want it or not.

There are, however, some critical differences between this frontier and its predecessors. For one thing, while there was no question that the government in Ottawa had legitimate jurisdiction over the Yukon, the same could not be said of the relationship between Washington and Cyberspace.

Cyberspace, being a region of mind rather than geography, is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. There are no national borders. The only boundaries which are significant are those which one crosses by entering a password. The location of those systems is irrelevant.

What difference does it make that the actual whereabouts of a hard disk is, say, California, when one may as easily actuate its heads from a keyboard in Berlin as from the desk it sits on? The Internet is essentially one great machine (or, better, organism) all elements of which are continuous if wide-flung.

Nevertheless, the American government maintains the conceit that someone moving encryption software from a hard disk in California region of that great digital Critter to another in the Berlin region would be engaged in the illegal international shipment of embargoed arms.

Or take the case of a Cupertino, California couple who were recently convicted on federal charges of distributing materials deemed pornographic according to the community standards of Memphis, Tennessee.

In both of these case, a local government is trying to apply its ordinances upon all of Cyberspace, and thus the entire planet. This might work for a time. Because of the American origins of the Internet, Cyberspace seems "ours," rather as Panama once did. This won't last long. As increasing numbers of non-Americans jack in, even such little willingness to submit to Washington as now exists will cease.

And it's unlikely that any new external power will arise in Washington's place. The Internet was designed to survive nuclear ordnance raining down all over it. This required that it be headless and self-organizing. It is thereby as resistant to Washington's efforts to control it as it would have been to Soviet efforts to decapitate it. It is the largest functional anarchy the world has ever known and is likely to stay that way.

Thus, the electronic frontier also differs from its predecessors in that setting up reservations is not likely to suffice for corralling the natives. As digital pioneer John Gilmore said, "The Internet deals with censorship as though it were a malfunction. It routes around it."Furthermore, unreal estate is unlimited. Unlike land, they are making more of this stuff. If you don't like the politics of the system you're on, you can set up your own for the price of a clone and increasingly cheap Internet connection.

There is, in addition, an irresolvable mismatch between the accelerating pace of technology and the changes it will enact upon the terrain of Cyberspace and the geological ponderousness with which the conventional legal structure of any jurisdiction, physical or virtual, can adapt to those changes.

Unfortunately, while governments have been good at imposing limitations, they show little capacity for accepting their own. Personally, I don't believe that government as we've known it as a promising future. I think the terrestrial powers will pursue us into Cyberspace and die of confusion there, thrashing  arbitrarily and crushing miscellaneous unfortunates as they do. Like rabid dinosaurs, the fact that they're doomed will not make them any less dangerous.

And while I have some faith that the netizens will eventually find appropriate and effective means for securing as much order as they want, I also expect that various sorts of bad craziness will afflict them for some time to come. Skagway, 1900 might look like a nice place to raise a family compared to Cyberspace, 2000.

It is because of these twin co-evolving perilous opportunities that Mitch Kapor and I founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation back in 1994. At the time, we perceived our narrow purpose as being the protection of digital expression and the enhancement of digital community.

Now EFF's expanding charter extends to resisting the last ditch efforts of the old Industrial Age powers to colonize and subdue Cyberspace, while helping the folks who pass much of their lives there to find practical means for ordering their own affairs. I hope you will join that effort, either with us or by independently struggling toward your own approaches to these problems.

And don't be dismayed. Jack in. Go to Cyberspace, and go with all the adrenaline and goofy optimism which ought to accompany frontier enterprise. As I say, I don't think you have much choice, so you might as well make the best of it.

But don't come to this wild place expecting to civilize it, as I once did. This frontier may well be permanent And, finding bedlam, please don't send for your troops. They will only get in the way of a future which you will have to invent yourselves.

Jackboots on the Infobahn: Clipping the Wings of Freedom
========================================================

WIRED 2.04

Electrosphere

Clipper is a last ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old Industrial Era, to establish imperial control over cyberspace.

By John Perry Barlow

On January 11, I managed to schmooze myself aboard Air Force 2. It was flying out of LA, where its principal passenger had just outlined his vision of the information superhighway to a suited mob of television, show- biz, and cable types who  fervently hoped to own it one day - if they could ever figure out what the hell it was.

From the standpoint of the Electronic Frontier Foundation the speech had been wildly encouraging. The administration's program, as announced by Vice President Al Gore, incorporated many of the concepts of open competition, universal access, and  deregulated common carriage that we'd been pushing for the previous year.

But he had said nothing about the future of privacy, except to cite among the bounties of the NII its ability to "help law enforcement agencies thwart criminals and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications to commit crimes."

On the plane I asked Gore what this implied about administration policy on cryptography. He became as noncommittal as a cigar-store Indian. "We'll be making some announcements.... I can't tell you anything more." He hurried to the front of the  plane, leaving me to troubled speculation.

Despite its fundamental role in assuring privacy, transaction security, and reliable identity within the NII, the Clinton administration has not demonstrated an enlightenment about cryptography up to par with the rest of its digital vision.

The Clipper Chip - which threatens to be either the goofiest waste of federal dollars since President Gerald Ford's great Swine Flu program or, if actually deployed, a surveillance technology of profound malignancy - seemed at first an ugly legacy  of the Reagan-Bush modus operandi. "This is going to be our Bay of Pigs," one Clinton White House official told me at the time Clipper was introduced, referring to the disastrous plan to invade Cuba that Kennedy inherited from Eisenhower.

(Clipper, in case you're just tuning in, is an encryption chip that the National Security Agency and FBI hope will someday be in every phone and computer in America. It scrambles your communications, making them unintelligible to all but their  intended recipients. All, that is, but the government, which would hold the "key" to your chip. The key would separated into two pieces, held in escrow, and joined with the appropriate "legal authority.")

Of course, trusting the government with your privacy is like having a Peeping Tom install your window blinds. And, since the folks I've met in this White House seem like extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers - hell, a lot of them are Deadheads -  I was sure that after they were fully moved in, they'd face down the National Security Agency and the FBI, let Clipper die a natural death, and lower the export embargo on reliable encryption products.

Furthermore, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the National Security Council have been studying both Clipper and export embargoes since April. Given that the volumes of expert testimony they had collected overwhelmingly opposed  both, I expected the final report would give the administration all the support it needed to do the right thing.

I was wrong. Instead, there would be no report. Apparently, they couldn't draft one that supported, on the evidence, what they had decided to do instead.

THE OTHER SHOE DROPS

On Friday, February 4, the other jackboot dropped. A series of announcements from the administration made it clear that cryptography would become their very own "Bosnia of telecommunications" (as one staffer put it). It wasn't just that the old  Serbs in the National Security Agency and the FBI were still making the calls. The alarming new reality was that the invertebrates in the White House were only too happy to abide by them. Anything to avoid appearing soft on drugs or terrorism.

So, rather than ditching Clipper, they declared it a Federal Data Processing Standard, backing that up with an immediate government order for 50,000 Clipper devices. They appointed the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the  Department of Treasury as the "trusted" third parties that would hold the Clipper key pairs. (Treasury, by the way, is also home to such trustworthy agencies as the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.)

They reaffirmed the export embargo on robust encryption products, admitting for the first time that its purpose was to stifle competition to Clipper. And they outlined a very porous set of requirements under which the cops might get the keys to your  chip. (They would not go into the procedure by which the National Security Agency could get them, though they assured us it was sufficient.)

They even signaled the impending return of the dread Digital Telephony, an FBI legislative initiative requiring fundamental reengineering of the information infrastructure; providing wiretapping ability to the FBI would then become the paramount  design priority.

INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS

Actually, by the time the announcements thudded down, I wasn't surprised by them. I had spent several days the previous week in and around the White House.

I felt like I was in another remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. My friends in the administration had been transformed. They'd been subsumed by the vast mindfield on the other side of the security clearance membrane, where dwell the  monstrous bureaucratic organisms that feed on fear. They'd been infected by the institutionally paranoid National Security Agency's Weltanschauung.

They used all the telltale phrases. Mike Nelson, the White House point man on the NII, told me, "If only I could tell you what I know, you'd feel the same way I do." I told him I'd been inoculated against that argument during Vietnam. (And it does  seem to me that if you're going to initiate a process that might end freedom in America, you probably need an argument that isn't classified.)

Besides, how does he know what he knows? Where does he get his information? Why, the National Security Agency, of course. Which, given its strong interest in the outcome, seems hardly an unimpeachable source.

However they reached it, Clinton and Gore have an astonishingly simple bottom line, to which even the future of American liberty and prosperity is secondary: They believe that it is their responsibility to eliminate, by whatever means, the  possibility that some terrorist might get a nuke and use it on, say, the World Trade Center. They have been convinced that such plots are more likely to ripen to hideous fruition behind a shield of encryption.

The staffers I talked to were unmoved by the argument that anyone smart enough to steal a nuclear device is probably smart enough to use PGP or some other uncompromised crypto standard. And never mind that the last people who popped a hooter in the  World Trade Center were able to get it there without using any cryptography and while under FBI surveillance.

We are dealing with religion here. Though only ten American lives have been lost to terrorism in the last two years, the primacy of this threat has become as much an article of faith with these guys as the Catholic conviction that human life begins  at conception or the Mormon belief that the Lost Tribe of Israel crossed the Atlantic in submarines.

In the spirit of openness and compromise, they invited the Electronic Frontier Foundation to submit other solutions to the "problem" of the nuclear-enabled terrorist than key escrow devices, but they would not admit into discussion the argument that  such a threat might, in fact, be some kind of phantasm created by the spooks to ensure their lavish budgets into the post-Cold War era.

As to the possibility that good old-fashioned investigative techniques might be more valuable in preventing their show-case catastrophe (as it was after the fact in finding the alleged perpetrators of the last attack on the World Trade Center), they  just hunkered down and said that when wiretaps were necessary, they were damned well necessary.

When I asked about the business that American companies lose because of their inability to export good encryption products, one staffer essentially dismissed the market, saying that total world trade in crypto goods was still less than a billion  dollars. (Well, right. Thanks more to the diligent efforts of the National Security Agency than to dim sales potential.)

I suggested that a more immediate and costly real-world effect of their policies would be to reduce national security by isolating American commerce, owing to a lack of international confidence in the security of our data lines. I said that Bruce  Sterling's fictional data-enclaves in places like the Turks and Caicos Islands were starting to look real-world inevitable.

They had a couple of answers to this, one unsatisfying and the other scary. The unsatisfying answer was that the international banking community could just go on using DES, which still seemed robust enough to them. (DES is the old federal Data  Encryption Standard, thought by most cryptologists to be nearing the end of its credibility.)

More frightening was their willingness to counter the data-enclave future with one in which no data channels anywhere would be secure from examination by one government or another. Pointing to unnamed other countries that were developing their own  mandatory standards and restrictions regarding cryptography, they said words to the effect of, "Hey, it's not like you can't outlaw the stuff. Look at France."

Of course, they have also said repeatedly - and for now I believe them - that they have absolutely no plans to outlaw non-Clipper crypto in the US. But that doesn't mean that such plans wouldn't develop in the presence of some pending "emergency."  Then there is that White House briefing document, issued at the time Clipper was first announced, which asserts that no US citizen "as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product."

Now why, if it's an ability they have no intention of contesting, do they feel compelled to declare that it's not a right? Could it be that they are preparing us for the laws they'll pass after some bearded fanatic has gotten himself a surplus nuke  and used something besides Clipper to conceal his plans for it?

If they are thinking about such an eventuality, we should be doing so as well. How will we respond? I believe there is a strong, though currently untested, argument that outlawing unregulated crypto would violate the First Amendment, which surely  protects the manner of our speech as clearly as it protects the content.

But of course the First Amendment is, like the rest of the Constitution, only as good as the government's willingness to uphold it. And they are, as I say, in the mood to protect our safety over our liberty.

This is not a mind-frame against which any argument is going to be very effective. And it appeared that they had already heard and rejected every argument I could possibly offer.

In fact, when I drew what I thought was an original comparison between their stand against naturally proliferating crypto and the folly of King Canute (who placed his throne on the beach and commanded the tide to leave him dry), my government  opposition looked pained and said he had heard that one almost as often as jokes about roadkill on the information superhighway.

I hate to go to war with them. War is always nastier among friends. Furthermore, unless they've decided to let the National Security Agency design the rest of the National Information Infrastructure as well, we need to go on working closely with  them on the whole range of issues like access, competition, workplace privacy, common carriage, intellectual property, and such. Besides, the proliferation of strong crypto will probably happen eventually no matter what they do.

But then again, it might not. In which case we could shortly find ourselves under a government that would have the automated ability to log the time, origin and recipient of every call we made, could track our physical whereabouts continuously,  could keep better account of our financial transactions than we do, and all without a warrant. Talk about crime prevention!

Worse, under some vaguely defined and surely mutable "legal authority,"they also would be able to listen to our calls and read our e-mail without having to do any backyard rewiring. They wouldn't need any permission at all to monitor overseas calls.

If there's going to be a fight, I'd rather it be with this government than the one we'd likely face on that hard day.

Hey, I've never been a paranoid before. It's always seemed to me that most governments are too incompetent to keep a good plot strung together all the way from coffee break to quitting time. But I am now very nervous about the government of the  United States of America.

Because Bill 'n' Al, whatever their other new-paradigm virtues, have allowed the very old-paradigm trogs of the Guardian Class to define as their highest duty the defense of America against an enemy that exists primarily in the imagination - and is  therefore capable of anything.

To assure absolute safety against such an enemy, there is no limit to the liberties we will eventually be asked to sacrifice. And, with a Clipper Chip in every phone, there will certainly be no technical limit on their ability to enforce those  sacrifices.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

GET CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CRYPTO EMBARGO

The administration is trying to impose Clipper on us by manipulating market forces. By purchasing massive numbers of Clipper devices, they intend to induce an economy of scale which will make them cheap while the export embargo renders all  competition either expensive or nonexistent.

We have to use the market to fight back. While it's unlikely that they'll back down on Clipper deployment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that with sufficient public involvement, we can get Congress to eliminate the export embargo.

Rep. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, has a bill (H.R. 3627) before the Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that would do exactly that. She will need a lot of help from the public. They may not  care much about your privacy in DC, but they still care about your vote.

Please signal your support of H.R. 3627, either by writing her directly or e-mailing her at cantwell@eff.org. Messages sent to that address will be printed out and delivered to her office. In the subject header of your message, please include the  words "support HR 3627." In the body of your message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. You may also express your sentiments to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs chair, by e-mailing hamilton@eff.org.

Furthermore, since there is nothing quite as powerful as a letter from a constituent, you should check the following list of subcommittee and committee members to see if your congressional representative is among them. If so, please copy them your  letter to Rep. Cantwell.

\> Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee:

Democrats: Sam Gejdenson (Chair), D-Connecticut; James Oberstar, D- Minnesota; Cynthia McKinney, D-Georgia; Maria Cantwell, D-Washington; Eric Fingerhut, D-Ohio; Albert R. Wynn, D-Maryland; Harry Johnston, D-Florida; Eliot Engel, D-New York; Charles Schumer, D-New York.

Republicans: Toby Roth (ranking), R-Wisconsin; Donald Manzullo, R-Illinois; Doug Bereuter, R-Nebraska; Jan Meyers, R-Kansas; Cass Ballenger, R-North Carolina; Dana Rohrabacher, R-California.

\> House Committee on Foreign Affairs:

Democrats: Lee Hamilton (Chair), D-Indiana; Tom Lantos, D-California; Robert Torricelli, D-New Jersey; Howard Berman, D-California; Gary Ackerman, D-New York; Eni Faleomavaega, D-Somoa; Matthew Martinez, D- California; Robert Borski, D-Pennsylvania;  Donal Payne, D-New Jersey; Robert Andrews, D-New Jersey; Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Alcee Hastings, D-Florida; Peter Deutsch, D-Florida; Don Edwards, D-California; Frank McCloskey, D-Indiana; Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio; Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois.

Republicans: Benjamin Gilman (ranking), R-New York; William Goodling, R- Pennsylvania; Jim Leach, R-Iowa; Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; Henry Hyde, R- Illinois; Christopher Smith, R-New Jersey; Dan Burton, R-Indiana; Elton Gallegly, R-California; Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida; David Levy, R-New York; Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Ed Royce, R-California.

BOYCOTT CLIPPER DEVICES AND THE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE THEM.

Don't buy anything with a Clipper Chip in it. Don't buy any product from a company that manufactures devices with Big Brother inside. It is likely that the government will ask you to use Clipper for communications with the IRS or when doing business  with federal agencies. They cannot, as yet, require you to do so. Just say no.

LEARN ABOUT ENCRYPTION AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES TO YOUR UNWIRED FRIENDS

The administration is banking on the likelihood that this stuff is too technically obscure to agitate anyone but nerds like us. Prove them wrong by patiently explaining what's going on to all the people you know who have never touched a computer and  glaze over at the mention of words like "cryptography."

Maybe you glaze over yourself. Don't. It's not that hard. For some hands-on experience, download a copy of PGP - Pretty Good Privacy - a shareware encryption engine which uses the robust RSA encryption algorithm. And learn to use it.

GET YOUR COMPANY TO THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING REAL CRYPTOGRAPHY IN ITS PRODUCTS

If you work for a company that makes software, computer hardware, or any kind of communications device, work from within to get them to incorporate RSA or some other strong encryption scheme into their products. If they say that they are afraid to  violate the export embargo, ask them to consider manufacturing such products overseas and importing them back into the United States. There appears to be no law against that. Yet.

You might also lobby your company to join the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a coalition of companies and public interest groups - including IBM, Apple, Sun, Microsoft, and, interestingly, Clipper phone manufacturer AT&T - that is  working to get the embargo lifted.

ENLIST!

Self-serving as it sounds coming from me, you can do a lot to help by becoming a member of one of these organizations. In addition to giving you access to the latest information on this subject, every additional member strengthens our credibility  with Congress.

In his LA speech, Gore called the development of the NII "a revolution."And it is a revolutionary war we are engaged in here. Clipper is a last ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old Industrial Era, to establish  imperial control over cyberspace. If they win, the most liberating development in the history of humankind could become, instead, the surveillance system which will monitor our grandchildren's morality. We can be better ancestors than that.

Just Say Yes
============

Commencement Address to the Class of 1992

Fountain Valley School Colorado Springs, Colorado

by John Perry Barlow, Class of 1965

Saturday, May 30, 1992

You people are so beautiful. And I'm not saying this simply because of the dramatically improved estrogen to testosterone over my graduating class, but I was watching you last night and I found you marvelously erect, alert, self-possessed, and, most importantly, openly affectionate to one another. The Class of '65 was not like this. And lord knows, we were all homelier...

So I'm very happy to be here today. But I didn't come because I thought I'd like you so much. I came because I love irony and I knew I'd find some here.

Not there was any shortage in my last venue. In order to be here today, I abandoned the company of the Grateful Dead in Las Vegas, a cultural combination as deliciously paradoxical as any I might dream of.

But, nevertheless, Fountain Valley was able to up the ante in this department. I say this because distinguished person up here before you now spent his entire  Fountain Valley career on disciplinary and academic probation. To return here in this honorific role feels less like vindication...though there is a small and nasty bit of that...than it does like a holy joke, the sort of prank which God loves to play on humans.

That I would be here today would not have been a particularly plausible prediction on this day 27 amazing years ago. At that point, I wasn't even planning on living to such an advanced age as I have since beat all peril to achieve, much less doing so in such a fashion as to render myself a fit speaker for anyone's commencement. But, as I am fond of saying, man plans and God laughs.

This seems especially true at the moment. Never has the act of planning been a more ridiculous waste of time and imagination than it is in a world as whimsical, chaotic, cut-loose, and plain unpredictable as this one has become.

I mean, the news is now so regularly surreal that I find it helps to flap my arms while reading the paper...if I take flight, then it's likely that I am dreaming.

Anyone who doesn't have an an appreciation of irony will miss a lot of the fun over the next 20 or so years. It is the kind of world which will favor those with a high tolerance for ambiguity and confusion. It is the kind of world which will reward courage and audacity and the ability to leap on the ephemeral opportunity. It is the kind of world which will sharply penalize rigidity.

In such a world as this, your greatest enemy is, as it always has been, what Franklin Delano Roosevelt called, "Fear itself."

This is not, or should not be news. Fear has always been the only enemy. Over 2500 years ago, Lao-Tsu wrote these words in the Tao Te Ching:

There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy.

Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.

Neither Roosevelt nor Lao-Tsu were talking about a literary abstraction. They were talking, as I am, about your fears and mine, the little fears we fear too much to admit to anyone.  Like the fear that we might be unattractive or stupid or unlovable.  The fear that we might fail completely and fall all the way to the streets.  The fears each of us harbors.  I'm now going to let you in on the best kept and most destructive secret of life among the adults:  Everyone else is just as scared as you are.

That may be especially hard for you to swallow this morning.  I remember my own high school graduation.  I was scared.  I felt like I was staring into an abyss...something called the Real World.  In this hazy realm dwelled monsters, each aware of my hidden inadequacies, each ready to exploit them.  I stood on the brink of the Real World and I just knew that it was going to have me for breakfast.

That was twenty seven years ago this week.  I don't believe I've encountered this terrible Real World yet.  What I have encountered is a safe place, a nurturing place, a good place to raise kids. What I've encountered, despite many misadventures,  has convinced me that the universe is on our side.

Now that is a basically theological statement, and this is not a pulpit. So I won't talk about the real source of that belief, but I will give you one somewhat scientific supporting example.

I want you to consider the phenomenon of life.  Those of you who paid any attention to your physics or chemistry know about the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  This grim little piece of cosmic legislation essentially states that the universe is going flat on us, that a process called entropy is irreversibly dimming all light, cooling all heat, and disarranging all order.  20 or 30 billion years from now, gray will be a very big color around here.

The pessimists often take entropy to be a metaphor for human affairs as well, confirmation of their suspicion that every change is for the worse. And as a physical law, entropy's airtight.  But as a metaphor it doesn't hold up so well.

Life, human or otherwise, flows directly against entropy.  The accelerating spiral of history is ascending.  It is not a whirlpool.  Life sprays into the cosmos like a fountain of order, layering complexity on complexity, miracle on miracle.  Whether you want to call the source of that fountain God or something else, there exists a process in the universe which defies the forces of decay.  Each of you owes his or her existence and future to that process.

Big talk, huh? What about the fact that you didn't get into college or don't have a job this summer or think you are just plain hopeless.  What's all this universal energy stuff got to do with the really important things?

My point is that if there is a positive design in which all of life participates, that design asserts the existence of every living thing, including such apparently trivial examples as me or you.

But you can cross-thread yourself with nature.  The preference of your own willed impositions to the bounty of Providence will be honored...to your disadvantage.  To avail yourself of this invisible safety, you've got to believe in it.  Like Wile E. Coyote, if you look down, you will fall.  This is why paranoids are so often right.

This too may seem a little unhelpful.  I feel kind of like the guy with the big, crazy Röttweiller who says, "Hey, don't worry, he only attacks if he thinks you're afraid of him."

It's not enough for me to get up here and tell you that you have nothing to fear.  For one thing, you've got an entire society which is, every day, filling your ears with a message precisely contrary to mine.  Years ago, I saw a bumper sticker which seemed funny at the time.  It said, "Help, the paranoids are after me." It's not funny.  The paranoids are after us!

I think the primary reason they're on the move is spiritual.  This is a spiritually impoverished era.  Once great enveloping metaphors have been reduced to articles of scientific fact.  Even religion seems increasingly obsessed with history and embarrassed by mystery.  The universe becomes an increasingly wild and windswept region, unmapped by divinity, miscellaneously hostile to all which inhabit it.

They're left with a kind of nameless dread.  Well, no one likes his dread to be nameless, so the first task is to divide it up and put some names on it, names like child abductors, or sharks, or, my personal favorite, terrorists.  Now we can all agree that these are threats worthy of our fear, right?  A closer look will show you how arbitrary this process really is.

Take the matter of missing children.  Milk cartons, billboards, post office walls stare back at you these days with the forlorn eyes of missing children.  Tens of thousands of them, we're told, are snatched away every year.  It's heart rending stuff, especially if you're the father of three little girls.

However, when I call the National Missing Children Help Center, I learn that in the 9 years they've been open, they've dealt with only 93 cases nationwide in which the missing child was actually abducted by a stranger...about 10 a year.  That's 93 more than there ought to be, but it hardly justifies training the other 60 million children to fear all strangers.

What about sharks?  Surely sharks are something to worry about.  Actually, the marvel is how gracefully two such abundant and dangerous animals as sharks and humans share our little planet .  Among animals weighing more than 40 kilograms, sharks are second in number only to humans.  There are almost as many of them as there are of us.  And yet, in an average year, fewer than 30 shark attacks are reported worldwide.  You're probably more likely to be fatally bitten by a loved one than you are by a shark.

Ok, what could be scarier than a terrorist?  The name says it all. Certainly they have had a profound effect on American life.  Everything from the main focus of our foreign policy to what you go through to get to Des Moines has been altered by our national terror of terrorists.  (Which is, by the way, exactly what they want...) Do you know how many Americans died in terrorist attacks in 1987?  Seven. Worldwide. That's fewer people than were killed by lightning while golfing.

In a very real sense then, we are the terrorists.  The handful of lunatics who bear that name for us merely oblige our need to fear something concrete.  And in being afraid, we do their best work for them, limiting civil liberties and covertly amending the constitution to meet the peril they pose.  As St. Theresa of Avila said 500 years ago, "I do not fear Satan half so much as I fear those who fear him."

In addition to the popular support for bogeymen, there are institutions and individuals which owe their very existence to insecurity, mistrust, and dubious danger.  I don't attach any real wickedness to their intentions, but neither do I expect them to violate self-interest by joining me in my sunny assessment of our chances.

Among these are the legal profession, the military, and the corporation.  A tough trio to buck if you believe in power at all.  But nevertheless, they all have a stake in your fear.

Each and every one of us is now represented by two and one half times as many attorneys as we were in 1970.  That's two and a half times as many people trying to imagine and prepare for every conceivable ill which could befall us, two and a half times as many people painting for the rest of us a world filled with treachery and negligence.

Where would they be if you suddenly started living on faith in the good will of your fellow man?

Then there is the military. There are billions and billions of dollars riding on the proposition that we are in imminent danger from a country whose leader consistently rates higher in American public opinion polls than our own president.

Could America go on building all those expensive new nightmares if you suddenly decided that our fear of the Soviets was more dangerous than the Soviets themselves?

And finally there is the corporation.  I'm currently writing a book about corporations so I think about them a lot these days.  To me the most striking aspect of corporate life is the extent to which they exert almost totalitarian control over their employees.  Not only is there no real freedom of speech inside modern corporations, the requirements of team play exert a form of thought control which is as thorough as anything you'd find in eastern Europe.

What, I wondered, are those employees getting which would be worth giving up such a precious thing as liberty?  What they are getting is the delusion of security.  What big business provides its constituents is the assurance that as long as they remain within the corporate veil, as long as they don't step out of line, they will bear little direct responsibility for their actions and they will never go hungry.  Until, of course, their corporation is taken over by somebody who decides they are expendable.

In the meantime, they strike precisely the same bargain with their company that the people of the Soviet Union once struck with the State: they trade freedom for certainty and diminished vulnerability.  In a society which is as basically pessimistic as Russia has been and the United States is becoming, it isn't hard to find people willing to make such a cruel trade.

What will corporate America do for employees if folks like you suddenly decide that life itself is safe enough for you to live it without hiding within the vast immune system of a corporation?

Whatever our motivations, I think we're making most of this stuff up just to scare ourselves.  And in the process we ignore the miracles of safety which surround us every day.

The other afternoon I was on 101 heading south of San Francisco right before rush hour.  I had one of those clear moments in which I saw this spectacle as though for the first time.  Here were 8 lanes of traffic, tens of thousands of people hurtling along at 65 mph, separated by inches, talking on car phones, fiddling with their bio-feedback tapes.  And nobody was getting killed!  These people worry themselves sick about nuclear energy and then pull this death-defying stunt twice a day.  Very strange.

Or take a look at your own young lives.  Unless teenagers have changed since I was one, you have all senselessly risked your necks more often than your parents could stand to know, and yet here you are.  Something is looking out for you.  Trust in it.

Now I'm not saying that there are no legitimate causes for concern.   I'm not Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.  As even paranoids have real enemies, the human race faces real problems.  I wouldn't council we ignore them.  We really ought to stop clear-cutting rain forests. We probably shouldn't manufacture any more fluorocarbons.  I'm not even sure we should be venting 250 million cubic feet of CO2 every day down at Shute Creek.

But before we allow a sense of on-rushing doom to paralyze us, we should be mindful of two things:  First, the world has been going to hell for the entire length of recorded history and it hasn't made it yet.  I think we can trust this trend to continue indefinitely.

Second, the one thing we can say with certainty about the future is that our present visions of it will look pretty silly by the time we get there. As recently as 70 years ago, the darkest shadow on the future of urban America was what to do with all that horse manure.

In other words, there will be problems, but they aren't likely to be the ones we predict.

This will apply equally to you as individuals.  I can stand here tonight and promise you that the looming disasters which will keep you awake years from now will either never come to pass at all or will seem far less dire when they do.  As Mark Twain put it, "I'm an old man and have known many troubles, but most of them never happened."

I wasted literally years of sleep on the impending loss of my ranch.  And finally I lost it...leaving me the opportunity to lead a life of such a rich adventure that I if someone offered to give me back the Bar Cross, free and clear, I'm not sure I'd take it.

In other words, you won't really know the object of your fear until it's realized.  And then you may find, as I did, that the dreadful thing is preferable to the certainty it replaced.

Besides, such safety as you can make yourself is really only secure from within.  It will imprison you but it will not keep you safe.  It will force you to lead a life which is short on meaning and low on memories. The most it can give you in return is money.

But the accumulation of money is an accelerating treadmill.  I know a lot of extremely wealthy people. Not one of them has enough money.  Not one of them feels secure in his wealth.  In fact, life around the rich has led me to what I call Barlow's Law of Economic Insufficiency:  "The more you make, the shorter it feels."

There are no walls you can build around yourself which can't be swept away in an instant.  There are no Keogh plans or IRA's which can't go belly up, no stocks which can't plummet, no jobs that can't be eliminated, no security systems which can't be breached. Indeed, it sometimes seems that our most vigorous efforts to smooth the twists of fate become like lightening rods for disaster.

If the pursuit of wealth is an exercise in futility and all manufactured security is illusory, what makes it worth getting up in the morning? Meaning, accomplishment, bliss, love.  When you find something to do that makes you feel whole and excited and interested, do that thing and do it as well as you can.

Joseph Campbell said, "Don't spend your life struggling to climb the ladder of success only to discover that it was leaned up against the wrong wall."You can choose your own ladder and you can choose your own wall.  You can do what makes you happy.

How do you do that?  It's really very simple.  You decide not to be afraid. You adopt an attitude of faith and trust in the safety of the world.  You make of yourself an open vessel for opportunity and chance.  You learn to say Yes to the universe.  As the Egyptian poet C. P. Cavafy wrote:

For some people the day comes When they have to declare the great Yes or the great No. It's clear at once who has the Yes ready within him; and saying it,

He goes from honor to honor, strong in his conviction. He who refuses does not repent. Asked again, He'd still say no. Yet that no-the right no- Drags him down all his life.

So just say Yes!  Say Yes to experiment and risk and your own hidden greatness.  Say Yes to the unknown and the unforgettable experience.  Say Yes to a life lived wide awake.

If we had the time, there's a lot more free advice I'd like to lay on you. I'd like to talk to you about kindness.  I'd like to tell you how much I think it means to come from a place like Pinedale.  I'd like to persuade you that all worldly importance is overestimated.

But actually I think all that will be covered if you'll just say Yes.





Leaving the Physical World
==========================

For the Conference on HyperNetworking, Oita, Japan

by John Perry Barlow

Like very few Americans of my generation, I come from the physical world.

I spent most of my working life running a large cattle ranch, first as a cowboy and then as a cowman, earning a living from things I could touch and smell.

This career involved the continual and palpable presence of such non-abstractions as the hindquarters of a hundred cows plodding through sagebrush before me or the sound of my ball-peen hammer banging on cold and greasy metal. I found myself constantly hard up against the physical world, whether digging holes in rock-packed glacial rubble or stringing barbed wire as far as the eye could see.

I conducted this enterprise...if any such unprofitable endeavor could be called an enterprise...in the last part of America still holding out against the advancing Information Age. This is where our great and bogus cultural myth of independent, kick-ass-and-take names individualism, having finally ran up against the finite limits of physical resources, space, and the resilience of nature, is down to.

It's Aristotle's last stand. occidental arrogance having finally become confused in its trajectory of dominion. Plato is about to have his day. Or even better, Heraclitus. Better still, Nagarjuna.

I come from that Great Blank Slate, the American West, now migrating across video displays into eastern Europe and Japan, universally known as Marlboro Country.

(Indeed, I was for several years in the horse business with the actual Marlboro Man, a neighbor of mine, who would have been appalled at the international familiarity of his face. In the service of his sanity, he stayed home.)

When I was a kid growing up in Wyoming, there seemed nothing artificial, or even particularly romantic, about this place. Soon its tarted-up advertising after-image will be all that remains of it.

The country I grew up in is about the size of the Netherlands and even today supports fewer than 5,000 people. When I was a boy, I actually rode horseback three and a half miles through deep snow to a one-room schoolhouse. We didn't have television. (Nor did we get it in any useful sense until the advent of the satellite dish in the late 70's). We barely had telephone service.

Here, guns were part of the furniture, and my taciturn neighbors used them on one another with heart-breaking regularity. These domestic killers rarely went to jail, since they could usually remind the jury that the deceased, whom most of the jurors knew, needed killing anyway.

This is one of the last parts of America where, despite all our vaunted independence, community not only exists, but remains a practical necessity. We are united by shared adversity and a common enemy, the natural, physical world.

Until recently, Nature always seemed to us an implacable, irrational, invincible foe which must somehow be placed in harness and turned to the work of Man. It is always present and trying to kill you. Absolute temperatures of -50ƒ Celsius and wind chills of -70ƒ are not so uncommon. Life sometimes feels a practical joke played on man by God.

This is a very placeful place. In my little town people often live out their lives in the same houses they were born in, a condition of geographical relationship almost unheard of in the rest of the country, where the average citizen moves 17 times over the course of his life.

It is the sort of place where there is no privacy and little need for any. People generally tolerate and even brag about one another's peculiarities. And we are a little odd. We descend from people who were chased here by their unwillingness to fit into anyone's program elsewhere.

Thus, this became a culture disinclined to impose any programs of its own. These people don't talk much, but are determined to be able to say whatever they want whenever they feel like it.  Shame is almost unknown among us, though a kind of easily provoked self-loathing is endemic.

We are tough, suspicious, friendly, testosterone-poisoned, alienated, local, violent, reductionistic, industrious, resourceful, mechanical, brutal, and honest. We are meat-eating, big-bellied, alcoholic and generally fairly crazy. We're not good at taking orders or giving them and do not erect large organizations of any sort.

In other words, I come from the Homeland of American Individualism.

We remain the apotheosis of everything America for a long time thought itself to be.  Around here we suspect it isn't true any more. Ours is a culture of the physical world, a place which, increasingly, the rest of America no longer inhabits. It is certainly true that America no longer earns its living there.

After 17 years in the cattle business, I was forced to conclude that

America has developed an economic system which does not supports those who traffic in material goods.

Whether you are the Bar Cross Land and Livestock Company or U.S. Steel, if your product is both tangible and American, you are in trouble. (Actually U.S. Steel is now called, with unintentional irony, USX, having shifted its bleary focus onto...what..X?)

There are a lot of reasons for this, and Alvin Toffler has already identified most of them. But he missed an important one, and that is this: much of that Popular Science future we American kids dreamed of in the 50's may have actually come to pass.

In that vision of pastel enamels and stainless steel, the machines would do all the heavy lifting necessary to keep us in food, shelter, and clock radios. We humans would be liberated into an Elysian condition of permanent leisure. We'd have nothing to do but hang out in our indestructible miracle-fiber jump suits and talk philosophy.

Only it didn't happen quite like that. The machines did get many of our physical jobs alright, but no one could quite figure out how to pay us for all that hanging out. So, aside from the homeless people who now throng our cities, most of us weren't given that option.

Instead, we became "knowledge workers". We spend our days florescently lit, shipping around terabytes of data in the service of obscure purposes.  We assemble presentations, reports, and memos, works as ephemeral as the electronic haze from which they emerge. We might as well be shovelling smoke.

Having been driven out of the factory and off the land, we "earn" handsome livings from bytes which no one can chew, architecture no one can inhabit, and software which keeps no cold winter wind from anyone's bodies.

In fact, I  believe most of this activity is a giant make-work project designed to keep us out of trouble and on the payroll while Asian robots churn out most of the physical  things we really need, and I would guess most knowledge workers secretly suspect this as well.

Many of us would go back if we could. The money's not bad, but so many people would rather make things they can touch, under conditions they can experience with their whole bodies, that there will long be a greater supply of these nostalgic "physicalists" than the economy needs.

At present levels of productivity, half the farmers who still farm could feed America without difficulty, and it's a pretty safe bet that if half of that half gave it up, the remainder would just become twice as productive within five years. Whatever it took to remain around dirt and obviousness.

People will do a lot to maintain consciousness, identity, and the sense that they occupy an objectively verifiable condition where the quality and need for their work is well-apprehended.

But work, in the sense of my previous career, and indeed, the careers of most humans since the Neolithic, no longer exists to any large American extent. Where work was once physical exertion which transformed sunlight and minerals into food, shelter, and warmth, much of it now involves transforming thought into value. This sounds suspiciously like something for nothing to me, but it seems to be working.

Anyway, whether I like what it says or not, I've never been one to ignore the handwriting on the wall. Concluding that ours had become an economy which would now consistently reward bullshit over bulls, I sold the Bar Cross in the spring of 1987, and am thus the first historically recorded male from either side of my family not to pass his whole career in agriculture.

I managed the ranch for the new owner a little over a year. In June, 1988, I walked from the ranch my great great uncle founded and became a knowledge worker myself. I was determined to make this disspiriting prospect as entertaining as possible.

Not long before this I had been asked, for reasons too convoluted to relate here, to co-author a book about Apple Computer. As I knew nothing about computers or corporations, I figured this might be a good way to start. So I moved my little family to the Silicon Valley and started looking around.

I wasn't there long before fleeing back to Wyoming, but I discovered a number of surprises which have commanded my attention ever since.

First, I learned that computers were not just faster adding machines, toiling the grim vineyards of columnar arithmetic. Nor were they even typewriters improved beyond the need of white secretarial error-correction paint.  Instead, they could become. when connected together, a new kind of place.

I discovered a computer called the WELL. Inside it were minds whose bodies were scattered all over the world.  As I found myself cruising its conceptual back streets, it felt like a small town whose inhabitants were invisible but were nevertheless engaged in the kind of thing I could recognize from rural experience to be human community

Like Pinedalians, these WELLbeings were an irascible bunch, likely to go off all over you without much cause. Unlike Pinedalians, they loved to talk. About everything.  Which was not so surprising when one considered that talk was literally all they were made of.

They were humanity stripped of racial characteristics, pheromones, sexual identities, personal style, and, in fact, bodies.. Words were all of themselves they could bring here. But nevertheless this crowd of strangers chattering at one another in the electronic darkness seemed to me immensely pregnant with the possible.

The WELL, I later learned, is but one small backwater in a global electronic matrix called the Internet. If one can count it, the Internet connects some 800,000 (mostly UNIX) computers (to any of which thousands of individual minds might also be attached). Growing exponentially since the late 60's, the rates of Internet growth now sometimes exceed 25% per month! The mindscape inside this network seemed vast and wild.

And yet somehow familiar too. Despite being a very different place, it shares many of Wyoming's historical characteristics. Like the Old West into whose waning days I was born, this place has a lot of unmapped terrain, resources which are barely understood, wild sociopaths operating in the absence of social contracts yet to be drawn, and alarming ambiguities about the nature and ownership of property.

At first, I called it the Datasphere, but then I read Neuromancer, a 1984 science fiction novel by William Gibson. In it he had a 21st Century digitally created landscape of information and mind called Cyberspace.

Gradually, I realized that Cyberspace had been around since Alexander Graham Bell met someone named Watson there in 1876. Cyberspace is where you are when you're on the phone.

Despite its gathering presence among us, we hadn't noticed it before because, unlike computer bulletin boards and larger networks, phones have no apparent spatial dimension unless one is making a conference call (which is another fairly recent development). Their linear end-to-endedness hides from callers the dark "space" which surrounds the path of conversation.

Besides, Cyberspace is pretty "thin" at present, despite being the new home of most of the world's wealth and business.  When I first happened upon it, it was so thin that one could only take his mind there. But I also found underway efforts to "thicken" it using a technology called Virtual Reality. Jaron Lanier and others, whom I came to know well and work with, are developing methods to inject the body into the heretofore spiritual realm of the immaterial. Now, I realized, would the Flesh be made Word.

Another of my disorienting Silicon Valley discoveries was that even those Americans who have never seen a modem are coming to live in environments which are almost entirely virtual. Glued to the one tube all day and another all evening, they are rapidly trading the old stuff of life for information, which is, in Lanier's words, nothing more than "alienated experience".

Televisonland spreads out from the screen and across the land, covering it in one continuous array of homogenized marketing iconography...McDonald's, Toys R Us, the Mall. Generica the virtual. It smooths the texture of place, becoming a kind of decal to be interchangeably affixed to any terrain without regard to the local characteristics of geology or climate.

In the Silicon Valley, I never know whether I'm in Mountain View or Sunnyvale or Campbell. They all look the same, and, in fact, they all look more or less like what one finds outside Austin or Boston. Most Americans can't be said to come from anywhere at all.

Third, my studies of Apple (about which I concluded I didn't want to write a book as soon as I realized that it was more myth than mission) led me to a variety of realizations about the modern corporation.

The most striking of these was that all large human organizations have more in common with collective organisms than the machines after which their management is still conceptually designed. The American captains of industry remain pleased to think these things as ship-like. They imagine themselves on the the bridge, their hands on something which definitely connects to the rudder.

In fact, individual humans, regardless of station, are as about as likely to "run" large corporations as coral polyps are likely to run reefs. I've been told that Japanese management understands this a little better.

I further found that detachment from such artifacts of physicality as space, time, and Newtonian predictability was having a profound effect on the nature of organizations, tending to favor the creation of small, fast-moving, short-lived adhocracies...digitized hunter-gatherer groups roaming the steppes of Cyberspace.

And finally, fourth, in another example of the never-ending strangeness of life, I woke to find myself having become something like a cross between Tom Paine and Wyatt Earp in this new electronic frontier... both attempting to maintain its independence and culture from the tyranny of the Old (physical) World it was replacing, and helping maintain a certain measure of community and order in its wilds. (The irony of having this role thrust on a renegade physicalist wasn't lost on me.)

After a disorienting visit from the FBI in May of 1990, I wrote a rant called Crime and Puzzlement, which led to my establishing with Mitch Kapor (who had previously founded Lotus Development Company) an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

We were joined in this effort by a group which now includes Apple founder Steve Wozniak, Whole Earth-ist Stewart Brand, computer guru Esther Dyson, cryptologist and early Sun Microsystems employee John Gilmore, Internet elder David Farber, and long-time ACLU Congression Liaison Jerry Berman. We were also joined, almost immediately, by an uncountable number of ghostly citizens of the Net.

At first we described the purpose of the Electronic Frontier Foundation to be, simply, the "civilization of Cyberspace." Now, after almost two years of operation, we also think of ourselves assisting in some Great Work, creating what may be nothing less than the united Mind of Humanity, hard-wiring the collective organism of human consciousness.

In preparation for that distant realization, EFF seeks policies of openness and easy access, as well as freedom and privacy of expression in digital media. At first we relied on such legal protections for speech as were provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But we soon realized that, in Cyberspace, the First Amendment is a local ordinance.

As a result we have shifted to a set of  strategies which we hope will result in the greatest ubiquity and redundancy of digital connections which can be achieved in the shortest time. We have come to see that "Architecture is Politics," as Mitch puts it. The fewer channels there are which are critical to the integrity of the overall Net, the more difficult it will be for any government to suppress it.

That this approach works was demonstrated during last summer's coup in the Soviet Union. The hierarchical information systems of the geriatric plotters in the Kremlin were no match for the horizontal andeks policies of openness and easy access, as well as freedom and privacy of expression in digital media. At first we relied on such legal protections for speech as were provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But we soon realized that, in Cyberspace, the First Amendment is a local ordinance. self-organizing networks of PC's and fax machines which informed their popular opposition in the streets.

Lately we have been working on a variety of fronts to accelerate deployment of ISDN in the U.S. and abroad. We are also fostering the growth of the Internet, acting as a kind of informal regulatory agency while the bases for electronic capitalism are defined.

EFF has also been heavily involved in matters pertaining to intellectual property and reminding society of the fundamental differences between soft and hard goods. We work on fostering virtual community, promoting network-distributed communications multimedia, and educating law enforcement agencies and corporate security forces on the culture and actual threat posed by computer "hackers."

The first half of my life was about landscape, place, dirt, physicality, facts, and experience. I now find myself trying to understand a world which has moved off the territory, where such things exist, and onto the map, where they are replaced simulation, thought, process, image, relationship, and information. In other words, information.

I have profound misgivings about this weird new place, but it has several advantages over the one in which I am leaving behind. (Besides, as we're headed there whether we want to be or not, one might as well enjoy the ride...)

Since most of its wealth derives from the most renewable resource of all...imagination...it is potentially far richer than the last New World we entered. Its basis in mental rather than physical terrain means that its frontiers will always be expanding. Thus, restless iconoclasts like me will always have some marginal region to explore. We'll never find ourselves stranded at the old frontier's terminus, as I felt myself to be growing up in Pinedale.

Its fundamental indefinability might do a lot to eliminate the national borders across which wars are fought. And the protean capacity of its inhabitants to present themselves any way they see fit may eliminate some of the cultural immune responses which have caused those wars in the first place.

Furthermore, it continues to offer the promise that humans can quit spending so much of the world's treasure travelling to physical proximity to other humans when they can assemble instead their far more portable minds.  And then there  is the potential conservation of those resources which we have traditionally devoted on impressing one another to an extent well beyond the requirements of survival. The trappings of prestige can be as easily manufactured from bytes as leather and brass.

We may also see something like the restoration of community, both inside and outside Cyberspace. Since I came this way, I have observed many examples of social congregation which could not have taken place without these media.

And finally, if you are able to pursue any work you like while leaving your body wherever it suits you, the small towns and villages of the world may be again repopulated with real neighbors. Perhaps we can retire that bleak human relationship which passes for neighborhood in the Global Suburbs.

This is not to say that the entry into Cyberspace is without hazard. For example, there may be almost no way to assure privacy there. While these electronic thickets may afford the best guerrilla jungle that ever harbored discontents, certain kinds of technological development could render it as flat and barren of hiding places as the salt deserts of the American West.

In its present condition, it lacks many of the communications media which people count on most heavily...body language, smell, style of dress, and culture. Reduced to pure content, opportunities for misunderstanding are rife and Cyberspace burns continuously with the flaming declarations of its inhabitants.

That there is already so much digital strife worries me. Most of the current population is male, white, affluent, young, well-educated, English-speaking, and suburban-acting. That such a homogeneous citizenry would find so much cause for dispute does not bode well for what will follow the arrival, already well underway, of people from completely different cultures. The opportunities to create innocent offense will increase dramatically.

But while the ascii howls of violation may clog hard disks all over the Net, vrtual bullets cannot kill. And the hybrid cultures we will eventually assemble there will not have, in the absence of boundaries and limited resources, the usual bones of contention to scrap over. Perhaps they will find ways to define the cultural Self without imperilling the culturally Other.

In any case, we are all off to Cyberspace whether we like it or not. The best we can to is to proceed with faith and try to enjoy the ride.





Mitch Kapor & John Barlow Interview
===================================

Mitch Kapor & John Barlow Interview by David Gans with Ken Goffman August 5, 1990

On the Electronic Frontier

Space may be the final frontier, but there's at least one more earthbound arena for the social-political-economic-technological struggle to take place before we need to worry about Martian mineral rights and the exploitation of Betelgeusian guest workers.

The United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights were created in the era of hand-set type, before the telegraph or the telephone or the broadcast media. Each new wave of technology has pushed at the boundaries of liberty and tugged at the coattails of authority by enabling more rapid and comprehensive dissemination of information and thereby throwing more light on the workings of government, business, etc.

I suspect "freedom" has always been for the elites of America, since (for example) the Emancipation Proclamation left enough work undone that a generation of well-heeled and well-educated white people found it necessary to head into the American South a century later to face the axe-handles and fire hoses of sheriffs and governors in an effort to make real what America's laws had only made "official."

It is only now, three dozen years into an unbelievably misery-free existence on Earth, that I have acquired even a glimmer of understanding of the struggles faced by southern blacks, my ancestors in Europe, and countless others throughout history. I have a hard time with the idea that the particular species of vegetable in my pocket could, if found by the wrong person, land me in jail and lose me my property. That's been technically true for quite some time, but only in the last few years has that particular river of darkness come close enough to my door to cause me concern.

Now it's my disk drive.

The advent of personal computers and modems, coupled with the immense penetration of the telephone network, threatens the hegemony of the government/corporate paradigm by empowering millions of individuals. Desktop communication in the '90s makes it virtually unnecessary to "publish" "revolutionary" documents in the old sense of the word, because information can be propagated across thousands of miles in all directions in a matter of moments and there is no way to stop it from happening short of dismantling the entire telephone system. This genie can never be put back in the bottle -- but that has not discouraged the Enforcement Community from doing its saurian best to try.

I have yet to encounter any seditious documents in my admittedly limited travels through the electronic frontier, but we're living in a world that attempts to suppress the use of certain words, herbs, images, ideas, and so on, and I'm pretty certain that my understanding of "dangerous" is pretty different from that of Authority in its many guises. Just one ridiculous f'rinstance: I host a weekly radio program in Berkeley; if the word "fuck" comes up -- even as a line of dialog in a song -- I am required by station management to bleep it lest they face reprimand or even the possibility of shutdown by the federal government.

But that's nothing compared to some of the other shit that's gone down lately. Case in point: Presentation of a set of negatives at a lab in San Francisco earlier this year led to storm troopers raiding the homes of photographer Jock Sturges and his lab assistant and the total destruction of Sturges' stash of a discontinued printing paper, the seizure of his entire archive, harassment of his customers, etc. -- without the filing of any charges whatsoever -- on "suspicion" of child pornography; this is the legacy of Edwin Meese. This material was not published, nor was it intended to be published; nor, according to the American Society of Magazine Photographers and others who have spoken out in the media, is the material that triggered the raid anywhere close to the edge of acceptability (whatever the fuck that means in a country that advertises freedom of expression).

Acting on requests from certain corporations, government agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service have raided businesses and the homes of private citizens -- including suburban teenagers -- and seized tremendous numbers of computers and related items, armed with warrants whose language is vague because even when the government knows what it's looking for, it often has no idea what it's looking at. It's analogous to removing an entire room full of file cabinets because of one suspicious folder. The enemy is ignorance, and the ignorant are making us their enemy.

This is why I found myself at sunset on a beautiful July day on the deck of a home overlooking Silicon Valley, participating in a good-natured but urgent gathering around the two founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The genesis of their alliance began with an arguably pointless act: some person or persons, probably an employee of Apple computer, "liberated" a piece of Macintosh operating code and sent it -- over the signature of "NuPrometheus League" -- to a number of industry figures, including Lotus Development Corporation founder Mitch Kapor. Kapor was unimpressed by the "gift," whose arrival on a floppy disk seemed unlikely to amount to anything more political or otherwise significant than an attempt to infect his computer with a virus.

John Barlow, a journalist specializing in technology who is working on a book tentatively titled Everything We Know Is Wrong, did not receive a floppy disk from NuPrometheus, but because he attended the fifth Hackers conference in October 1989 he received a visit from an agent of the FBI with regard to NuPrometheus -- only Agent Baxter referred to it as "New Prosthesis" and evinced a woefully inadequate grasp of the matter he was investigating.

"He referred to them as the New Prosthesis League," Barlow told the assembly, to general laughter.  "He was looking for something called 'the ROM Code.' He didn't know what a ROM chip was, he didn't know what code was, he didn't know whether it had been stolen or what exactly had happened or whatever it was.

"And I realized that what we were looking at there was a microcosm of a whole set of things that could now begin to happen with the government and with society and computers. And it was just a little pinpoint of future shock that was going to blow up into something big and ugly if we weren't very careful about how it got managed.

"A few days later I found out that this process was well under way in the Secret Service," Barlow continued. "They had come up with something called Operation Sun Devil and they were breaking into the homes of teenage kids, rousting them up in the middle of the night, coming along with guns, sledgehammers -- and, I assumed, no more knowledge of the situation than Agent Baxter had when he showed up in Pinedale."

"It's simply beyond the reach or grasp of 99.9% of the people today" Kapor added, "given the relative immaturity of the technology and the fact that there hasn't been a concerted effort made from within the industry and the academic research community to make the stuff usable. And if it's not made usable, there's going to be an increasing gulf between the information haves and the have-nots.

"That's what led us to the whole metaphor of the 'electronic frontier.' All of the good stuff that we know about is sufficiently difficult that only a few pioneers, some outlaws, maybe a few vigilantes, and early settlers, are comfortable.

"Out on the frontier, there aren't established laws or practices," Kapor continued. "We're making it up as we go along. But ultimately we've got to civilize the frontier. We have to allow ordinary folks to come and settle. We need to build the equivalent of railroads, because if we don't take the lead in doing it and it kind of happens by itself, it's probably not going to come out in a way that any of us really like it."

The Electronic Frontier Foundation began when Kapor, after reading (in the Well) an article Barlow had written about his visit from Agent Baxter, visited Barlow in Wyoming one afternoon. "We realized that there was a not so much planned and concerted effort to subvert the Constitution," said Barlow, "but the natural process that takes place whenever there are people who are afraid and ignorant and issues that are ambiguous regarding Constitutional rights.

"Whenever there's a new medium, there's always a struggle to find out whether the Constitution is going to apply to that medium, whether or not the first amendment will apply. There's now a struggle under way to find out whether free speech can be expressed in bytes and bits. And that's basically what the Electronic Frontier Foundation is about.

"We're looking at a whole range of things dealing with future shock, the anxiety of society at large toward computers, the particular anxiety of society at large toward \[hackers\], and what I like to call the learning curve of Sisyphus -- which is what happens when you've got a technology that develops faster than anybody's ability to learn it."

Shortly after the EFF reception in Silicon Valley, R. U. Sirius and I met with Barlow and Kapor for an extensive interview to learn more about their backgrounds and their plans.

\- David Gans

Barlow:   What happened is very straightforward, up to a point. On Mayday I got a visit from the FBI. I got this phone call from Agent Baxter down in Rock Springs. I was mystified, and there was something about the way he sounded over the phone that made me think he was mystified. I said, "What do you want to talk to me about?" and he said, "I'll tell you when I get there. I've got a stack of papers." And he did have a stack of papers.... that related to something called the NuPrometheus League, which was purportedly a group -- more likely not a group -- of people who had taken a little snippet of Apple's ROM code for the Macintosh and had sent it to, among other people, Mitch -- and MacWeek and ... I think they put a copy of it on the bulletin board at MIT....

Apple, which basically sells ROM code -- I mean, it's commonly thought l machinery, but what it sells is the software that's on the ROM chip inside that machinery, and that's the holy mojo that makes a Macintosh a Macintosh -- Apple freaked when that happened, and they invoked the awesome forces of the FBI -- which, for reasons having to do with corporate culture and their private security company, could act almost as though it were an extension of their security company because there is a revolving-door policy between the FBI and ... Apple's security contractor. \[ ... \] Gans:   The person or persons who call themselves the NuPrometheus League sent this piece of code out to a bunch of people, including yourself. Why did they do that and what was it?

Kapor:   I don't have the faintest idea why they sent it to me \[laughter\]. I just stuck the thing in the drawer, because it was an unlabeled diskette and I figured it was something funny and I didn't know what to think about it. I was afraid of viruses and getting infected.

Barlow:   \[laughing\] A disk says "Apple Source Code" on it, you know it's kind of like, "put me on your computer."

Kapor:   Several days later I said, well, let me go check this out. I took a machine that had nothing of value on it and I took it off the network, in case it was infected, and I stuck the disk in, because just sticking a disk into a machine on a Mac is sufficient for a clever virus to infect your machine.

When you put the disk in you get a little icon on the screen, it's an ie that looks something like a disk and it has a label, and it does say "Macintosh ROM Source Code." I figured to myself, "Ah, it must be a virus. \[laughter\] This is a come-on to get me to open it up." So took it out of the machine and I put it away. I've been around too long to fall for that one.

But then the story hit the papers that somebody, through some means, had actually taken a small and not terribly important piece of the source code for what is called 8-bit color QuickDraw and sent it out. And I looked at it again, this time long enough -- about five minutes -- to determine that it certainly looked like Apple source code. At that point I didn't know what to do, so I called up my attorney and said, "What am I supposed to do with this thing?" He said, "Send it back to Apple if that's what they want." So I sent it back to Apple, and I thought that was the end of it. Then several months later I got a call from the FBI. It was actually before John's visit.

Gans:   Did you guys already know each other?

Barlow:   Yeah. We'd met through the good offices of Mary Eisenhart, who had me interview Mitch for MicroTimes back in February. We became friends in the the first 30 seconds or so; it was a sort of one of those cosmic recognition experiences where you realize there is somebody else that is thinking some of the peculiar thoughts that you had previously thought that were yours alone -- coming at it from a completely different vector, but arriving at something like the same set of unusual conclusions.

Kapor:   We're both interested in dislocations of consciousness, because we think that's a central element to understanding how weird the world is: to understand how everybody's mind has gotten genuinely bent, especially by technology, especially by digital media. John is in the process of writing a book about this, and it's something that I'm absolutely fascinated with. We also had a common set of experiences in the '60s -- involving what In I speak to straight business audiences, charitably refer to as recreational chemicals -- that really I think contributed to a fundamental outlook --

Gans:   The olde acid heads' league...

Barlow:   Right! You got it, buster.

We're talking about that dislocation that occurs when an entire societys up and finds that it doesn't know where it is and it doesn't know how anything works anymore and doesn't understand things like place and embodiment and community and a whole number of fairly standard, nurturing concepts that have managed to provide for us since the Neolithic that are suddenly basically gone.

Kapor:   John's one-sentence definition of cyberspace is "the place you are when you are on the telephone" -- which brings it home to people.

Barlow:   It's kind of like what happens when you leave the landscape and move onto the map -- which is what much of society is doing, without paying that much attention to the process or the destination. And Mitch and I had had the same perception of the direction of things.

Gans:   Mitch, you have gone from \[being an acid head\] in the '60s to being one of the new heroes of digital capitalism these days. What's the view like from there? You're playing with those guys on a certain level and keeping this consciousness from another level; it's gotta be somewhat jarring to you from time to time.

Kapor:   It's important to understand that before I was a digital capitalist I used to teach meditation, and then I was a counselor in the psych unit of a local community hospital, which was a formative experience. I have a Master's degree in counseling psychology. So I've been pretty much all over the map. I just kind of fell into computers; I didn't set out to be Bill Gates -- Bill Gates set out to be Bill Gates -- my perspective was really never totally shaped by needing to succeed in building a big company and making a lot of money. In a nutshell, I started this little company called Lotus and made this software product that several million people wound up buying, and this little company turned into this enormous thing with thousands of employees making hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And it was awful. It felt awful to me, personally. So I left. I just walked away one day.

Gans:   In what way did it feel awful?

Kapor:   The things that were important to the business as an organism were things that I could demonstrate less and less enthusiasm for. And I'm interested in figuring out, among other things, how to design software and how to design digital media to do interesting, innovative, creative new things -- products that people can use. And what Lotus had to be interested in in order to serve the interests of its three million spreadsheet customers were things that had nothing to do with that.

Gans:   Did it occur to you when you walked away from that that you were essentially turning that large capitalist organism loose to do its will and thereby...

Barlow:   It was already a lot bigger than he was.

Gans:   But I'm wondering, if your values were somewhat offended by it, if there wasn't a way to sort of turn it?

Barlow:   You're still stuck in the notion that people run these things and that they don't have some method of running themselves.

Gans:   Well don't you think they ought to?

Barlow:   I don't think they can.

Kapor:   John has pointed out that it's the height of grandiosity to assume that any one person -- even the CEO of a company -- has more of an ability to steer the company than its three million customers.

Barlow:   What companies become is their market and not their maker. And Lotus is a beautiful case in point. So to say that Mitch could have somehow directed Lotus in some benign condition is like assuming a coral polyp can run a reef.... It's a collective organism.

Gans:   How is it being driven?

Kapor:   It's not.  That's the first thing that John and I keyed in on: that we have this assumption that because something exists and it moves it has some central controller, some little homunculus inside it that makes the thing go. But physics is dead as a model for organizations, and biology is in the ascendant. And if you study biology, things are very decentralized, distributed. You get emergent behaviors coming out of the workings of a whole bunch of little pieces, each one of which is pretty dumb, and organizations are like that. Still and all, I agonized over my responsibilities toward Lotus before .

And I had gotten to be extremely unhappy there as I saw the company's destiny and my destiny diverging and I had to ask myself, well maybe it was appropriate to be miserable and unhappy because I had some obligation to steer the thing to some better future.

Barlow:   It's like a co-dependent relationship with a company.

Kapor:   I ultimately decided that it was my belief that the company was going to become what it was going to become, shaped by market and technology forces that I really couldn't control, and that I could make myself miserable and be unsuccessful at the same time. And that didn't really seem even for someone with my predilections to be a good set of tradeoffs. So at that point I said "Well, I just have to do what I have to do and be prepared to live with the consequences," and I quit.

Barlow:   By the way, to back up for a second, there is this lingering assumption that there is some disjuncture between being a digital pioneer and being an acid head. And it's my perception on the basis of having interviewed a lot of the first wave that this is not an uncommon phenomenon at all. I think most of them have been beat up a little bit by the circumstances that they had to ride through and you know a lot of them -- I can think of one guy in particular at the moment who just basically wants to take care of his family.

Gans:   What about the reaction of old corporate America against new corporate America?

Barlow:   Well, the reaction of old corporate America to new corporate America is to meet it, to infect it with itself, and to create -- through the use of itself as a market -- a perfect replica of what was preexisting. So the difference between Lotus today and any other standardized American corporate entity is pretty slender, I think.

Gans:   Well, isn't Apple sort of becoming like GM in a way?

Barlow:   Oh, I think Apple's a lot worse than GM, because Apple is still clinging to a lot of mythology about what it is that just gets in the way. I mean if Apple could just kind of settle in and be GM or be Lotus or be one of these things, everybody there would be a lot happier.

Kapor:   It lacks the comfort and self-assurance of a mature organization which no matter how much you might disagree with its values has a certain degree of predictability. Therefore if you're on the outside of it you can adapt to it. Younger organizations that are still in the throes of violent organizational psychoses become very unpredictable.

Barlow:   It's as though the Cultural Revolution were being conducted by people in three-piece suits. Furthermore, any corporation, because of the intensity of the reality distortion field of the collective organism that is a large corporate entity, has a totalitarian quality. You have to put up with that if you want to work in there, and there are reasons to do it. But one of the reasons to do it is because it's supposed to be safe in there, right? You give up your mind but you get the benefit of the collective immune system, which will protect you against the slings and arrows of individual fortune, anyway. The thing with IBM, for example, which is a pretty good case, they rarely fire anybody and their retirement plan is beautiful. They take care of their employees, they don't let them say everything they might think or even think everything they might say. But they take care of them. Apple exercises much the same kind of totalitarian control over its employees and offers them none of the benefits. They have no retirement plan, period.

Kapor:   What they do is offer the vision of really trying to do something to make a difference in the world, which used to be much more true than it is today. There are enormous pressures in large organizations to get people to buy into the party line that are so pernicious that in a very big company you may have an atmosphere which is largely crazy and have individual islands of sanity. But when you leave your island of sanity -- when you walk across the street from your building out into the courtyard -- you start feeling crazy, if you're sane, because everybody else is crazy. And you go, "There must be something wrong with me. Everybody else is acting differently". So the pressures to adapt and to get crazy like everybody else are absolutely intense and you have to be sympathetic to individuals caught up in this who may have mortgage payments and they're not really prepared to give up the house, and... It's tragic.

Gans:   So who benefits?

Kapor:   Well the tragedy is nobody really benefits.

Barlow:   This is more like an ecological thing. That's kind of like saying, "What good are mosquitoes?" Well, mosquitoes arise because there was room for them in the ecology; corporations arose because there was an ecological niche in the economy that was provided by a lot of things including modern telecommunications, Taylor's scientific management techniques, organizational models that came as a result of having fought two fascist powers 40 years ago and come to resemble them in many respects \[laughs\] as a country.

Kapor:   So again, an assumption that if bad things are happening somebody is making it happen and benefiting from it is a model that is not always useful.

Gans:   I'm not asking who's doing it, I'm asking who's benefiting from it.

Kapor:   Fair question. There are incrementalized benefits all along the way. If you are a senior manager in one of these big firms you get a lot of perks. You've got a lot of a certain kind of power, especially the power to make other people miserable. There's a security benefit for people in those organizations in the mature form. There's a benefit for outside critics that these things exist, 'cause it gives them something to point at and say, "Gee, this shit is really awful!"

Barlow:   Not to mention inside critics who can spend all of their lives complaining about the bureaucracy of their organization and not having to think about the real stuff like man's place in the universe or whatever.

Gans:   We still end up with powerful incentives not to rock the boat.

Goffman:   Didn't George Bush say uncertainty is the enemy?

Barlow:   Oh, well that's a perfect corporate statement, because in my perception dealing with corporations -- and this is especially true if you come at em as an environmentalist, because what they see in environmentalism almost invariably is a great potential for uncertainty. And a corporation hatesuncertainty more than any other thing.

Kapor:   There's a natural conservatism to its collective organisms.

Barlow:   They don't like ambiguity.

Gans:   How do you end up here, still thinking for yourself?

Kapor:   I can't help it...

\[...\]

Barlow:   This brings us back to EFF, really, because when the FBI came to visit me, Agent Baxter shows up and when he arrives he doesn't know what a ROM chip is and he doesn't know what ROM code is and he doesn't know how one would steal it or if "steal" is even the word that one would use for whatever it was happened to whatever it was. And he thinks, among other things, that the old original phone phreak, John Draper, is president of Autodesk and that Autodesk is involved in top secret Star Wars defense contracts because of their Cyberspace -- which he calls Hyperspace -- system. This has all been sent to him by the San Francisco office; it's right there in black and white. He thinks that the NuPrometheus League is in league with another mysterious and shadowy group called the Hackers Conference (which was actually founded by Stewart Brand).  He called it the "New Prosthesis League," and I could never get him straight on that. \[laughter\] Furthermore, it was the considered opinion of Apple Computer Company that this Hackers conference would be the place in which you would probably find one of the New Prosthesis League -- but there was no particular point in asking those members of the Hackers Conference in the Silicon Valley, because they'd hardened their hearts against Apple. Some festering resentment of profit had turned them against Apple as an institution, so the only people they could expect to get any help from were the ones out in the hinterlands like Wyoming. Like me.

So here you've got a guy that is completely at sea -- I mean, he is in dreamland. I'm a potential perpetrator and I have to sit him down and spend three hours explaining to him very carefully the possible nature of my possible crime. This experience made me realize that the whole system has kind of jumped the groove and that we are now in a whole new world.... So I wrote something about this on The Well, just basically, "You know, a weird thing happened to me the other day..."

Kapor:   It reverberated with me deeply because it enabled me to begin to come to terms with a very disturbing experience that I had had that I'd been unable to process so I have just sort of repressed it:   my visit from the FBI, which had happened earlier. It had sort of been lying in an undigested state in some empty chamber of my brain.

My experience was remarkably similar to John's. They were asking a lot f questions, and I found myself working increasingly hard to explain to them what had actually happened just to create an intelligible account of mutual understanding between the two of them and me as to the sequence of activities which I'd described earlier:   I had this diskette, and I looked at it and I sent it back, and so on. And that took a couple of hours to get to the point where we all felt reasonably comfortable that... And I was exhausted, and we hadn't even gotten to their list of questions yet. And I felt bad, because it was pretty clear to me that they weren't in a position to do what they were supposed to be doing. And that meant they couldn't be doing anybody any good, because they'd be acting not intentionally but more or less randomly. And that just deeply offended my sense of order about things.

I sensed danger. I didn't know what the danger was going to be, but wheu have a powerful force with a charter and a history and fundamental misimpressions going around, it's sort of a recipe for disaster. And I didn't spend too much time thinking about what kind of disaster. In fact, since this is all new to me I didn't do much of anything with it. And so it just became like this little nagging piece of unhappiness every time I'd start thinking about this visit, and so I stopped thinking about it -- until I read John's piece. John was able to articulate some things about the way I was feeling so they finally made sense to me and we're able to talk about it. It was a big release.

Barlow:   Meanwhile, some other things had been happening that were not connected directly to this case but were certainly connected to the underlying cause. I had been part of a Harper's forum on computer hackers;Harper's periodically gets experts together and discuss issues of one sort or another, and they had convened kind of a grab-bag of digital types on the Well to talk about computers and security and privacy and crackers and hackers and all that sort of stuff. In the course of this I'd met these cyberpunk cracker kids from New York and elsewhere who were young and sort of brash, and there had been a kind of a nasty symmetry that set itself up over the course of the conference between the old techno-hippies and these new sort of digital skateboarders which had culminated in one of them downloading my TRW file with my credit history -- with the implication that he could change it if he wanted to --

Kapor:   Which was not true.

Barlow:   -- but I didn't know that, and I was thinking that I was looking at a lifetime of crumpled bills. Life without credit. Pretty scary.

So I e-mailed this kid and I said, "You know we've just exceeded the bah of this medium. Why don't you give me a call -- and I won't insult your intelligence by giving you my phone number." -- which is listed anyway, but I wanted him to have something to do so he hacked it out of the system and called me up about 20 minutes later.

The kid that I encountered on the phone was not at all the kid who'd ben strutting about in full digital regalia on the Well. He was a kid, you know:   smart, brash, New York kind of street-style kid, but nevertheless, not so dissimilar from what I had been at his age. And I got to know his colleagues, and they seemed to be pretty consistent with that image. They were unquestionably inclined to trespass, but I tend to think that that's sort of a testosterone-based endeavor that has been with us for some time. You know young adolescent males like to go places they don't belong. That's just what they do. And they just found a new place to go. I mean this was better than an equipment yard or a quarry or some of the old favorites.

I met them in New York, and I didn't find them to be any particular thrn spite of their willingness to go where uninvited. But at a certain point I found out that the government had moved in on one of my young colleagues and had smashed down his door one afternoon while he was out and held his 12-year-old sister at gunpoint for an hour until he showed up. And by the time he showed up they had loaded every piece of electronic gear that he owned, including boom boxes and telephone answering machines and things of that sort. One of the Secret Service agents held up his answering machine and said, "What's this?" And he said "It's an answering machine." And he says "What's it for?" And he says "It answers the phone." And the guy nods and says, "Yeah, sure."

I heard about his before I had my visit from the FBI. And I though wellI don't know what they did. I mean they're probably much worse than I thought. That's probably what it is. I mean I just, I didn't understand what they were up to and they probably deserved this or something. But I didn't do anything about it until I had the visit from the FBI. So I'm still thinking about this stuff, and I'm collecting information on it to write a piece for Whole Earth Review about the Harper's conference. I'm collecting information about the Legion of Doom, as they call themselves, and then Mitch gets in contact with me.having read the FBI piece and tells me he's going to California one afternoon and would like to drop in to Pinedale and visit. We sat down on a snowy afternoon for a couple of hours and I told him what I knew about the Secret Service operations. And I think that added to his sense of concern, to say the least...

Kapor:   Yeah, I just thought that these kids needed to have a good lawyer because it didn't seem that they had a good attorney and I didn't know what they had really done or what they hadn't done. But my sense was that there were great and powerful forces moving against them and that my sense of fairness at a minimum dictated that they have adequate legal representation to protect their rights and to make sure that bad things didn't happen to them. That's where it started.

Gans:   What does this software multimillionaire feel in common with these "digital skateboarders?"

Kapor:   You know, to the first order of approximation, I'm the same digital skateboarder that they are only I'm a little bit older and have more life experience. I was sort of a smart, nerdy, somewhat undersocialized kid. And believe me, had I had the opportunity to do what they'd done probably I would have done it. It just didn't happen to be available to me. But for instance Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, he used to sell blue boxes. I mean these things you phreaked the phone system. I can say that because it's pretty much a matter of public record. And so I identified with them, just in terms of background and style and stage of life, and I had a real concern that if they got screwed over in some way, not only would they be losers -- which was bad enough -- but we all would be losers in some fashion, because one of them might be the next Steve Wozniak.

Barlow:   Look, a very important point that we have to make over and over and over again is that this is not a crackers' defense fund. Trespass is and should be against the law for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that you could get in there and inadvertently create mayhem.

Robert Morris is an excellent case in point. Robert Morris wanted to do something that was really kind of cool and I wish he'd succeeded. He wanted to map the net. The Morris worm was like an explorer, it was going to go around to every node on the net and report back in and tell you just how big this sucker is. Which is something that nobody knows, right? It's a cool thing to do. Somebody ought to do it. The trouble is that he screwed up:   his worm was not well-written, so every time it got to a node it started reporting back, reporting back, and reporting back until all that processor was doing was reporting back. And the effect was viral rather than exploratory.

That's the point that I want to make about why it probably ought to be l to trespass. These people are entering into sensitive places; it's not quite like breaking into a quarry or an equipment yard, it's breaking into a place where everything is kind of fragile. The important thing to do, given that fact, is to make sure that there is an awareness of the level of both intent and threat so that you don't go around busting joyriders for grand theft auto -- which is what's going on now.

When I was a kid I actually did physically break into NORAD. I walked ie door after a wild night in the Colorado Springs woods nearby, to see how far I could get -- along with another guy. Well, the guards, who had seen my kind before and had been my kind not long before, just basically ushered us out. It was no big deal. If I'd done it with a computer, it would have been a big deal.

I think that's the kind of distinction you've got to make. Trying to ima million-dollar fine and thirty years in jail on them just because they've trespassed digitally rather than physically is completely out of scale and has to be dealt with -- and will be dealt with, because of what we're trying to do on a metaphorical level. We're trying to educate people about what this stuff really is and the level of threat it represents.

For example, when I first got involved with it, I didn't know but what y could change my credit record. If they could download it, they could change it. Well there's a big difference between read capacity and write capacity, it turns out. They were not in a position to do anything to my credit, but as long as the general mass of people think that there are folks out there who have these capacities and furthermore are culturally of a will to use them, then you got a recipe for repression and trouble.So we have to go out and sort people out on this stuff.

Gans:   How do you propose to do that?

Barlow:   Education, which is a long, slow, painful process. It's much more fun to say, "Well, we're going to go to court and kick ass and take names," and we just did a little of that and that's fun and it has some educational qualities. But really what we've got to do is a long, slow process of getting people to understand what the appropriate metaphors are, so that everybody understands that a computer is a printing press and a bulletin board is a town square or Hyde Park Corner, that e-mail is the same thing as mail. And that a bunch of e-mail in a bulletin board has the same protections as a bunch of real mail in a post office. Stuff like that.

Gans:   But at the same time this effort is going on there is an immense tide of repression going on in all of the old traditional realms and modes of communication.

Barlow:   No, I don't think so. I think if you check this out very carefully what you're going to see is that print is still pretty safe and speech is still pretty safe. Where you're running into trouble is every other medium. You're running into trouble with records, CDs, photographs, art, broadcast media, digital media. I mean if it's not print, where the metaphor is completely intact --

Goffman:   -- except for pornography--

Barlow:   Well, let's say words on a page. I haven't heard of any written pornography being busted either. It's photographic. If it's not speech, in the sense of words on a page, then it's up for grabs. Society at large does not have the McLuhanesque insight into this stuff at all; it really just thinks that speech is free expression is the press, and it hasn't caught up with the other ways in which you can express yourself.

.... We lost radio and television in the 20s and 30s, not a big civil libertarian time. They said, "Well, all right, there's a limited amount of bandwidth and we've got to regulate it, and in regulating it we've got to make certain that it meets the requirements of a wide audience."

Goffman:   Could the Electronic Frontier Foundation possibly step back a couple of decades and try to deal with that situation?

Barlow:   No you can't, because of the way in which the legal system works. There is a lot of what is thought to be constitutionally ordained that is not constitutionally ordained. It's ordained by precedent. You build up a body of case law over a period of time and pretty soon it had the same authority as it would have if it were part of the Constitution. Especially if it's you know in an area the seems to be inexplicit in the Constitution like broadcast media. I don't think there's a damn thing you can do about it, and what scared Mitch and me is we were going to have cases come down the line on digital media that would have the same kind of precedent-setting effect overnight and would fundamentally limit the application of the Constitution to bits and bytes since that's pretty much where it's all taking place already:   no newspaper or book even sees hot lead any more -- I mean it's electronic at some fundamental part of its development, and if you can restrict free speech just because it happens to occur in a magnetic medium, then it's all up for grabs.

Gans:   We need to continue to define these things as speech and preserve the Constitutional protections that we know belong, because as the technology develops the old media are going to be left behind and if we don't preserve the protections into the new media then we're going to end up with not only an information underclass, we're going to end up --

Barlow:   Oh yeah, the knows and the know-nots. And I think that's a real serious risk. Absolutely.

Gans:   And we're already in the information haves and have-nots, but we're also faced with the possibility of ending up in a place where the Bill of Rights is left behind with hot lead.

Barlow:   Well and I think that's a real concern because if you examine the situation you find that much of the rest of the Bill of Rights is already gone.

Gans:   What was it somebody said the other day? "The Bill of Rights isn't much but it's better than that we have"?

Barlow:   "The Constitution isn't much but it's better than what we have."I was shocked to find out that much of the Fourth Amendment had disappeared since the last time I had looked. When I called up these lawyers and said, "As I read the Fourth Amendment this is unreasonable search and seizure to a tee," they said, "Well, you've got to understand what's happened in terms of precedents on Fourth Amendment issues. We've basically lost it."

There's the general social pressure to get rid of that amendment and ite or less succeeded. It's the death of a thousand torts, you know. We're still pursuing that, because most of these Operation Sun Devil search warrants were first of all unsigned, and sealed, and furthermore were completely broad. They just said, "Get everything that has electronics in it and get everything that has magnetism on it."

The Fourth Amendment prevents you from having taken from you anything bt direct instrumentality of the crime and obvious evidence. And that's another case in point. I mean here you've got this stuff -- I mean, nobody knows. You can't see it -- I mean, you know what a gun is, right? You don't know what a computer virus is or where it might reside in 25,000 disks, so you take them all. It's kinda like if you're busting witches you don't know which of the brooms is transportation and which is for cleaning the house.

Goffman:   You're really in the area of conceptual crime.

Barlow:   Yeah, you're in an area where nobody understands what the paradigm is anymore. So there's bound to be a lot of trouble. These guys that came into Steve Jackson Games, not only did they take computers and hard disks, they took laser printers and all the floppies that they could find. And it's a little like saying, "All right, we've got white collar crime over here. This is an office of a corporation and we believe that there's a white collar crime that might be taking place in it, so I want you to go in, boys, and take every piece of paper you can find in every file because that's the instrumentality of crime." Well, people know what paper is, and they would know that that was an absurd request and it was overly broad and it was unconstitutional -- but they don't know that with ... in one day they confiscated 23,000 floppy disks. I mean that's billions of pages ... They didn't know what was on 'em. They still don't, I'm sure. The point I'm getting at is even though the Fourth Amendment has been pretty grotesquely eroded it's still there and has some potency, so...

Gans:   You're faced with a pretty serious uphill climb here.

Barlow:   There isn't anybody else out there doing it and Mitch and I felt that we didn't have anybody else to turn to, so we said we'd do it ourselves. And you know it's been an interesting thing in the sense that in spite of the fact that it was quite an open field a month and a half ago, the second that we raised our hat over the trench a lot of other hats came up:   Our two biggest contributors came to us right off the bat -- without any solicitation or even a very clear awareness of what we were doing with 6-figure sums -- just like that. Steve Wozniak and John Gilmore registered right in.

Gans:   What about the reaction of some of the mainstream of the industry?

Barlow:   This is another one of those cases where what it really devolves down into is institutions versus individuals. Institutions want to own information, they think they already do, they think everything is proprietary that is not explicitly not so. They're very uncomfortable with the way in which they do own information because it doesn't seem quite tangible enough to them. It involves a great level of uncertainly, which institutions hate. And so thereTs a natural institutional response to try to be overprotective of the interests of the future at the expense of individuals, about whom institutions by their nature could care less. A corporation doesn't care about individual rights, that's just not something that it cares about.

Gans:   Why don't the individuals who work there --

Barlow:   Because the individuals who work there are no longer individuals. I mean there's a big difference between a solitary wasp and a wasp's nest. It's a big difference. It's all the difference in the world. It's like slime mold:   it's basically like a paramecium-style, one-celled organism most of the time. When it decides that it wants to cover some country because conditions are changing for whatever reason, it's getting too dry or something, all the local slime molds get together and create an organism which grows stalks with eyes on the ends of the stalks and grows cilia to move the whole thing with and suddenly it's a critter.

Goffman:   They call it grexing, I think.

Barlow:   Yeah! It's an animal then; it's not a one-celled animal any more, it's a multicellular organism, and it goes someplace and then it devos. It goes back down to its original constituents. This is really the perfect metaphor for what a corporation is. And to say that the individuals inside that corporation are individuals when they are acting in their corporate form is like saying that slime mold is still a whole bunch of slime mold cells. It's kinda true, but it's not true enough.

We still have this notion that organizations are machines -- this sort f Newtonian, causal, deterministic model of an organization which has got the CEO up in the wheel house and there's a direct connection between the chairman's desk and the rudder.

Gans:   CEOs tend to think that, too...

Barlow:   Well, of course they tend to think that. They'd like to think that. I think the best of them know better and are even willing to admit it, but it's their job to think that. That's what the organism wants them to think. The point is that the organism exerts enormous reality distortion on everything within it.

The Secret Service wants to expand into a new market. The old market --h was not protecting presidents, as many think, but the busting of counterfeiters -- moved offshore. All the forgers are overseas now to the extent that there are any. So in order to have a reason to allocate a budget and to go on existing as an organization and to feed itself as a critter, the Secret Service has to find some new food. So the Secret Service gets into computer crime, and does a rather bad job of it. They're getting terrible advice from the telcos, and the telcos are trying to use the Secret Service, rather as the FBI is being used by Apple. You call the telcos and ask them a question about computer crime and you know you're talkin' to somebody from the Secret Service just like that. You know, there's a really direct connection and the Secret Service agents were showing up at all these busts with telco security people, you couldn't tell them apart. And my theory about that by the way is that government as an institution is now grinding to a complete halt, in fact may have already done so, and so what is actually running stuff to the extent that things are getting run is corporations. They're mediating the economy, they're passing the goods and services around, they're doing all the control stuff, they're keeping things in line, they're managing the consciousness, they're doing all the economics. And now they're moving into law enforcement.

Goffman:   Very much the cyberpunk vision...

Barlow:   Yeah, exactly.

\[Conclusion tape\]

Kapor:   We decided to help these two kids. We got the attorneys involved, and then we asked them to look into what was going on with a variety of government investigations and prosecutions. We identified a couple of particular legal situations, like Craig Neidorf in Chicago and Steve Jackson Games, where there seemed to us to have been a substantial overstepping of bounds by the government and an infringement on rights of free speech and freedom of the press. We were in the process of deciding how to intervene when we also realized very clearly that we didn't want to be a legal defense fund as that was too narrow. What was really needed was to somehow improve the discourse about how technology is going to be used by society; we need to do things in the area of public education and policy development.

It was at that point that we started talking seriously to Marc Rotenberf Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, an organization of which he heads the Washington office and runs the Computing and Civil Liberties Project. They have for many years been actively involved in tracking all legislation current and pending that is wending its way through the Congress that affects people's rights to privacy and so on with respect to information technology. We concluded that we could best channel financial support not into creating a duplicative organization to do the same thing, but by funding CPSR to expand the activities of its own program.

Barlow:   Which would do something important, and that is to treat the disease rather than the symptoms. As long as we were just going to fight brushfires in court every time there was some legal confusion about technology, we would have an awful lot of brushfires to fight because this is going to come up a lot now. The question of intellectual property is going to become ... the point over which the arguments take place that will either maintain freedom of or limit digital communications. So we had to start talking to people that could make a difference, and we're fortunate to have CPSR out there already to do something valuable.

Gans:   So at this point it was just basically happening between the two of you deciding you wanted to do something?

Barlow:   It still is. This is a very lean little organization:   It's still just us -- and Mitch's wife, who is the third member of the board.

Kapor:   And financial support from Steve Wozniak and John Gilmore and a lot of discourse and input from friends and supporters and others, almost all of which is electronically mediated through the Well and the Internet.

Barlow:   It's a very collegial scene in the sense that where there might be a limited number of votes there are certainly a large number of voices that can be heard and processed. We're open to suggestions.

Kapor:   We're really a node in the network. We've identified ourselves as a node and we've linked to other nodes and we've discovered other nodes, which are people and groups which are pursuing similar ends. And periodically we have the occasion to do something face to face, to get a bunch of people together to have good, old fashioned face-to-face contact.

Gans:   So in addition to funding CPSR and these two legal efforts, what other sorts of things do you have in mind? And what specific things do you think might be coming up soon?

Kapor:   Well one area that we're looking at, and we think it's terribly important to do something, is in improving people's access to the public network. Today there are some marvelous things you can do in communication by electronic mail and conferencing, with many hundreds of thousands of people all over the world, that substantially expand the scope and reach of your contacts and your community. There's one catch:   you kind of have to be a 'nix weenie, or know one, to be able to use those particular tools that have that capability. One thing we think is terribly important is to lower the barriers to entry, to let more ordinary folks participate in discussions in the worldwide network.

Barlow:   One of the things we've left out here, oddly enough since it's our overriding metaphor for what it is that we're doing, is "civilizing the digital frontier." What we mean by that is that cyberspace or whatever you want to call it, that region that is defined by electronic communications and information and the place you go when you make a telephone call, is presently inhabited almost exclusively by mountain men and desperadoes and vigilantes and kind of a rough bunch -- and 'nix weenies. \[laughter\] And as long as that's the case it's just gonna be kind of the law of the wild in there. And it's going to continue to have this extremely uneasy relationship with the rest of society, which is going to depend on it more and more in a very material way -- and already does. You can't believe the number of things that you do every day that involve activity in cyberspace.

Kapor:   When you use an automatic teller machine, for instance.

Barlow:   When you make a financial transaction, really. You don't that often use money, you use electronic data representing money ... So we feel very strongly that the most important thing we can do to minimize anxiety and to make certain that the things we love about the so-called real world stay intact in the virtual world, the most important thing we can do is to make it inhabitable by ordinary settlers. You know, move the homesteaders in.

Kapor:   And that's such an enormous proposition to do that that you have to find a place of high leverage. And where we think the leverage is is in demonstrating that it is possible to have relatively straightforward worldwide interconnectivity -- mail, conferencing and messaging. The infrastructure already exists -- the parts and pieces, the Internet and so on -- but the problem is that the access tools are real hard to use. What we'd like to do is something more in the way of a demonstration or pilot project that shows how, simply by adding a bit of software here and a bit of software there, you can lower the access barriers to the worldwide network to let more ordinary folks in. The whole point of doing that is to show to other people -- software companies and other developers -- that's it's worthwhile investing in this area. Because the history of it is that the companies in the newspaper industry and the broadcast industry have lost, collectively, billions of dollars in failed videotext experiments in this country. And it enjoys a terrible reputation. Because they went about it in the wrong way, based on the wrong set of premises, with the wrong technology, it is impossible to get anybody to invest in building --

Barlow:   They didn't go about it as an effort to design an open system, basically. They wanted to provide everything.

Kapor:   They were replicating the television networks.

Barlow:   They were going to shove this stuff at you in whatever form they wanted it to be in. They didn't realize that what you really wanted was a much better kind of a telephone, in a sense.

Gans:   Minitel \[France\] being the obvious example of a successful system...

Kapor:   That's right. What happened there was that the government subsidized the initial development by giving away terminals and by putting the national 411 service on this thing. The government does not provide those kind of subsidies to its citizens in this country; you couldn't even get 5 minutes of a congressman's time for that. So we think it's really going to have to be private sector kind of stuff.

(break)

Kapor:   One of the interesting things we found out is that the EFF was welcomed with open arms in Washington, because there are not very many organizations that are knowledgeable technically that aren't industry trade associations. IBM and Digital have representatives there, and there are the trade organizations. But outside of that, there isn't anybody with any kind of credibility in Washington that can talk about information technology issues and policy issues. And so they want more input, they want more participants in the process. There are going to be some very central issues that will probably come before the Congress. For instance, whether and how to let the telephone companies into the information services business fully. Right now they live with a very very tight set of restrictions imposed on them by Judge Greene. But it's becoming more and more apparent that there's a kind of a standoff between the phone companies on one hand and AT&T and information providers on the other hand. And so it may just go into a complete rewrite of the communications act of '34 in which the pie gets redivided up about who can do what, and who can lay fiber optic cable, and what's a common carrier for digital pathway to everybody's home, and what's universal service... We think it's important that the EFF play a role in that, certainly to the extent of understanding the issues and helping sort out where the public interest might be -- and possibly beyond that, once there is some sorting done to take an advocacy position on how we think the national public network ought to be constructed so that it's of maximum benefit for everyone and not just particular corporate interests. So we're expecting to get up to speed on that issue and find our way through the maze that lies inside the beltway.

Gans:   Have there been any surprising instances of corners from which you have not gotten support? Or from which you have gotten opposition?

Kapor:   Well I have to say there's a lot of skepticism from my colleagues in the computer industry, some of whom initially felt that the EFF was in the business of defending people's right to break into computer systems, and the EFF was attempting to destabilize the intellectual property system by observing that technology had raced ahead of the law's ability to keep up with it.

I think the intellectual property system of patent and copyright is alry pretty destabilized it, it doesn't need us to push it around any. It's tearing itself apart, unfortunately, pretty much on its own. What I found is that there is a certain complexity to these issues. There's a certain amount of nuance and flavor; it's not simple black or white. We do much better when we sit down one on one, or at least when we get a chance to speak directly with people. Getting the message across through newspaper headlines, I think, has actually not helped us. Perhaps the most troublesome part of this, and why this is so enjoyable, is that in the effort to squeeze everything down to a sound bite -- which this is not -- somehow the real meaning gets sucked out of what we're doing and gets reduced to cliches and stereotypes, some of which are threatening. We're still spending a lot of time thinking about how, short of sitting down with everybody in this country face to face, do we craft the messages? How do we choose the metaphors? How do we talk about the urgent need to have a studied and open discourse about how we civilize the electronic frontier? How do we get beyond paranoia and hysteria and overreaction and oversimplification and sound bites, and deal with the sort of state of data shock that half of us exist in all the time anyway?

It's surprising how hard it is, how much noise there is in the channel t hackers, how many preconceived notions, how many people just assume that there is a nefarious criminal conspiracy to disrupt our nation's basic emergency services on the flimsiest -- actually, on the total absence of evidence. So it's just proved that we've got a lot of work to do, and we're not sure exactly how we're going to do all of it.

Goffman:   I was just reading a report in one of the computer magazines that had a quote from somebody from the prosecution of Neidorf -- and I think they even used your name:   "When Mitch Kapor finds out what's really going on in this case, he'll feel differently about it." And then, of course, when the case came out it was they who found out ...

Kapor:   That was Business Week, and that issue hit the stands within hours of the government dropping the case. So there was a bit of irony to that ... But it just goes to show that things are pretty weird out there in terms of a lack of straight communications. So it's part of the reason we exist to help reduce that.

Gans:   And so much of it seems to be informed by that sort of unenlightened corporate self-interest that characterizes corporate behavior, and so much of human behavior in general.

Kapor:   It's not only the pursuit of self-interest, it's the myopic pursuit of self-interest that focuses on very short term issues that -- it's just a serious national problem that goes far beyond technology and far beyond these issues. We've been busy enjoying ourselves in this country and creating a national right to own not one home but two homes and an RV, and indulging in all the wonderful benefits of materialism 'cause it feels good. I can't think of anything that's much more short-term than that, and meanwhile some other countries that didn't do so well in the last global conflict have employed a set of attitudes of a much more puritan nature in some sense -- a lot of delayed gratification among the Japanese -- and they've sort of zoomed past us in a number of respects. And I don't have a clue what to do about that problem.

Gans:   I don't know that we want a regimented society like that.

Kapor:   Well I don't think that we want a regimented society, but we might be able to have a society in which people...

Goffman:   Japan in a sense is like one big corporation in terms of John's model of being like a singular biological unit...

Kapor:   It is a very different kind of society and I think it is totally useless to try to adopt attributes of that organism here, because our immune system would just reject them. At the same time I wonder what it would take in this country to get people to act a bit more cooperatively, i.e., for people to understand that it is sometimes in their self-interest to minimize what they get tomorrow in order to maximize something that might come a bit later. And typically that happens by doing something with other people in order to achieve a result greater than what people can achieve by working individually.

Gans:   But where America conducts its business -- on television and in the marketplace -- it is all day-to-day bullshit. The lies of everyday existence -- "Buy this and you'll be happy" -- which we all sort of understand to be bullshit, has become the main focus of all of our communications with each other.

Kapor:   I think people have to turn off the TV. Now there's one of two ways to do that:   you could turn off the literal TV, the one that's out there in your living room, and stop watching it, or you could turn off the metaphorical TV, the one that's in your head.

Gans:   But that requires that people pay attention and think for themselves. In "Just say no" America, "Think for yourself" is a subversive statement and an incitement to revolution.

Kapor:   I think it's not a popular sentiment, but I don't see at the moment any other course that makes any sense.

I try very hard to avoid polarizing things in addition to the great degf polarization that already exists. But yeah, it's important that people think for themselves.

I think more than anything else we have to develop a real sense of patie and a long-term view, and not to measure any success or lack of success by what happens today, tomorrow, this week, next week or even next year. And to understand that as long as we're doing the sorts of things that we think are right then we've fulfilled our moral obligations and we just have to live with the result.

Goffman:   There's always the fear that we'll wake up tomorrow morning and discover that we're in an irreversible police state. Well, more or less a police state.

Barlow:   I actually don't share the opinion that we're terribly close to a police state. I think periodically there are eruptions that move us in that direction and that it is terribly important to do early detection and prevention of those sort of problems and that is one basis for the EFF intervening. And it would be a whole separate subject which we could talk about some time to talk about the evidence or lack of evidence that suggests that a police state is near at hand. But at least as of the moment that's not the EFF position.

Gans:   I think that one of the things that's happening now is just that we hear about them more readily and more frequently. The same amount of cop-think may have been going on throughout the century, but word of the busts... I mean right now we're hearing about all of the computer ones because of the immense speed and efficiency of the communications network, but all of the Ed Meese mechanisms that have been put into place are starting to really work now. But you and Barlow share this optimism and this general belief that things aren't as bad as...

Kapor:   Well I'm kind of an agnostic. Things could either be real good or real bad, but what we have right now is this moment.... It is possible to be consumed by despair and there is sort of an unfortunate tendency, on one end of the spectrum, to adopt the lifestyle of despair and to sort of elevate and honor despair and blackness and lack of hope as the new idol. I see it, but I have a hard time relating to it because I think it's sort of this self imposed, self-contained negativism that just has a lot of rage and frustration trapped in it. It's really kind of tragic.

Goffman:   What you guys are doing... must have been entirely unexpected on the part of sort of the people who busted these kids and so forth, that somebody would come out of the woodwork and \[defend them\] ... They must be a little shocked. Have you felt any of the reverberations of that?

Kapor:    Gail Thackeray, who was the assistant attorney general in the State of Arizona who was one of the principal spokespersons for Operation Sun Devil and other government activities, called me on the phone the day after the first national news story broke on this in the Washington Post and she said that she was shocked and surprised that I would take this kind of position. But she was operating out of a very different set of premises and assumptions that I had, and if you accepted her premises and assumptions then her view of the world made a lot more sense. Her premises and assumptions were that in fact there was a criminally conspiratorial band of hackers engaged in blatantly illegal activities, which was the purpose and function of their behavior. And I did not and do not share these premises, that was sort of why this conversation had such a bizarre, noncommunicative aspect to it, and I think it's terribly important that we expose to public scrutiny as many of the actual facts at all levels so that people can make up their own minds which myth they want to believe. You've got to shine some light on the thing.

Goffman:   It's interesting that a lot of the cracks that sound really dangerous at first, when they're examined up close wind up not being. And even in the case of that guy who was associated with the CHAOS Computer Club, who supposedly sold secrets to the Soviet 'nion, it turned out the secrets were completely worthless and they didn't really want to pay him for them.

Gans:   But that's not gonna stop the "security experts" who get mileage out of this stuff...

Goffman:   These things keep on getting punctured. But related to that, I'm curious about what you think of the idea that crackers actually could do damage to the social system.

Kapor:   Well, I asked the best ones that I know about this. I wanted to find out from the people themselves what the extent of their capabilities were. And it turns out the answer is pretty simple. It's what I call the "LSD in the water supply phenomenon":   could somebody put LSD in the water supply and effectively incapacitate unsuspecting individuals? I don't actually happen to know the answer to that, 'cause that's sort of a function of chemical properties and a whole bunch of physical facts. I do know that it apparently hasn't happened, or we would have heard about it. My surmise is that the reason it hasn't happened is not that it's impossible, it's that it's kind of difficult and there isn't anybody with the technical skill and the twisted personality and will to do that who's done it.

It's like that for all sorts of things, because when you get that combin -- like with hijackers and terrorists -- it gets a lot of attention and everybody knows about it. So the fact that that hasn't happened suggests that under the current circumstances it's not going to happen. Well, it's the same deal with these computer systems. The issue is not whether it is technically completely impossible, 'cause almost nothing is technically completely impossible. But it has to do with how likely is it to happen? And if the likelihood is as remote as somebody poisoning the water system, then I think we're OK.

That's the way the threat has to be assessed, not purely in terms of tel capability. It's always human beings who do that, and people don't act for arbitrary reasons, so what's the likelihood of this? And one important fact that is almost entirely missed in talking about the people who go into computer systems is that their motivation is exploratory for exploration's sake and they're terribly uninterested in the actual content of what's there. They could really care less about it. And not only that, they're only interested in exploring that which is reasonably explorable. Military computers -- computers that hold classified military information -- are not available by hooking up your computer to a modem and dialing up a phone number. They are physically separate. They don't have any interest in those kind of systems. They're sort of just not inside their purview. And I think that's not well understood. So they're fundamentally lacking some very important motivation and interest to even take a concern about that.

Second, for the really important stuff like the military computers and r traffic control system and other computer systems, they're not on the public network; you cannot dial into them. And I probably should have said that first, 'cause people don't know this. But you can't get at 'em and they don't care about them, and therefore I don't think we have to worry about vital national services being brought down.

"So what about the Internet worm and Robert Morris and this guy that temporarily paralyzed the Internet?". The question is asked. Well, he was engaged in exploratory behavior and his program had a bug in it and he accidentally paralyzed the thing but he did have quite an effect. It didn't really damage anything; it just cost a bunch of time to go and fix it up. No data got lost. There were no patients on operating tables... But the fact of the matter is that computer network, the Internet, is one where people don't and have never taken security seriously, in my humble opinion. It's all these research institutions and universities and they believe in open and free stuff, and the operating system that runs that has the world's more jury-rigged security that people don't honor and take seriously. And that's the problem, not Morris. Anybody who ran a commercial network with security like the Internet should probably be taken off the job. And in fact, that was the problem with the Bell South System that the kids in Atlanta went into:   they didn't have any security. If you knew the phone number you were into the system. This is what I've heard, and I find that credible. So there was a target of opportunity. I'm not justifying the action of the kids who went in there at all, but I am saying that if this is true then Bell South failed to exercise a standard of due care and if I were a shareholder or an officer of that corporation I would be very concerned about that. And so when an intrusion happens, trying to pin the blame on the hackers is not only unjust but extremely counterproductive. The real issue has to be, How do network system operators and users of networks, how ought we to act and what types of security are appropriate to ensure that people can go about doing what they are doing and feel secure and that there's privacy, i.e., there's no unwarranted intrusion, either from the government or private parties. But not sort of onerous, burdensome, and restrictive security. Those questions are not being asked. What we get is "Fry the hackers, these people are trying to bring down the air traffic control system." And that is the essence of the problem because if you misframe and misstate what the problem is, you're never gonna solve it. Never, never, never, never, never! You're just gonna keep makin' it worse and worse.

Gans:   So I hope that EFF would put some energy into educating the establishment side since...the security side.

Kapor:   You bet. We've already started. We've already started outreach and discussion with people from the computer security community and others and we're finding binding sites into those entities to talk about the stuff. We don't expect people to agree with us all the time, and while we do try to be as careful as possible, we understand that we may misunderstand or misstate things. But the nature of a good public discourse is that it allows for that and nobody tries to nuke anybody else. (end of tape)





Passing the Buck on Porn

Passing the Buck on Porn

by John Perry Barlow

Infoworld editor Bob Metcalfe recently wrote an editorial in which he claims that the Electronic Frontier Foundation "like the very many other civil liberties groups crowding opportunistically around the Internet, has thought little about decency beyond stopping Exon."

In fact, we have had considerable internal discussion and debate about how we might help prevent the Net from becoming a virtual Combat Zone. We are all uneasy with that so far unrealized possibility and have looked at ratings systems, filters, and even laws. So he is incorrect in claiming that we have given the matter little thought. But the practical realities are challenging.

For starters, there is the simple matter of enforcability. The Internet, in the words of another EFF co-founder John Gilmore, "deals with censorship as though it were a malfunction and routes around it." What is removed from one Net-connected hard disk may easily appear on another. And will.

There will always be places in the physical world where materials offensive to one or another of the world's cultures may find refuge from their police while remaining accessible to their constituents. If the government of, say, Alabama won't let me store dirty pictures on a site in that state, I can always rent space on a server in, say, Belize which would be open to world-wide access.

And it does seem there is something characteristically arrogant about the government of the United States believing it can legislate what the rest of the planet may or may not behold. It is a classic case of "Think Locally, Act Globally." Are we prepared for similar efforts on the part of the government of Saudi Arabia? Whose culture is to define planetary morality?

Furthermore, his allegation that one cannot cruise the Net without have "pornographic billboards in your face" makes me wonder what parts of the Net he's cruising. My own efforts...purely academic, of course...to find porn on the Web have largely been met with "server busy or not responding" messages every time I thought I was about to open a digital cesspool. Far from being in my face, these billboards are almost always invisible.

The reality is that children have far readier access to pornographic material at their neighborhood 7-11 than they do on the Internet. It is my perception that most kids still learn about pornography by discovering their parents' own secret caches  and distributing it among themselves, on paper, not in bits, in treehouses and not through computers. I suspect this will go on being true for some time.

I think the real issue here is responsibility. I believe that my sense of decency, and how to preserve it within a family which includes three young daughters, is a personal responsibility. Unlike many parents these days, I do not wish to pass this duty over to any institution, governmental or, as in the case of EFF, non-governmental. It's not their job. It is my own, unless I am too cowardly to assume it.

It's simple and hard. If you don't want your children fixating on filth, you'll get nowhere turning it into forbidden fruit which you can't, as a practical matter, truly forbid. Better that you step up to the tough task of raising them to find it as distasteful as you do yourself.

Selling Wine Without Bottles: The Economy of Mind on the Global Net
===================================================================

by John Perry Barlow

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

--Thomas Jefferson

Throughout the time I've been groping around Cyberspace, there has remained unsolved an immense conundrum which seems to be at the root of nearly every legal, ethical, governmental, and social vexation to be found in the Virtual World. I refer to the problem of digitized property.

The riddle is this: if our property can be infinitely reproduced and instantaneously distributed all over the planet without cost, without our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can we protect it? How are we going to get paid for the work we do with our minds? And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the continued creation and distribution of such work?

Since we don't have a solution to what is a profoundly new kind of challenge, and are apparently unable to delay the galloping digitization of everything not obstinately physical, we are sailing into the future on a sinking ship.

This vessel, the accumulated canon of copyright and patent law, was developed to convey forms and methods of expression entirely different from the vaporous cargo it is now being asked to carry. It is leaking as much from within as without.

Legal efforts to keep the old boat floating are taking three forms: a frenzy of deck chair rearrangement, stern warnings to the passengers that if she goes down, they will face harsh criminal penalties, and serene, glassy-eyed denial.

Intellectual property law cannot be patched, retrofitted, or expanded to contain the gasses of digitized expression any more than real estate law might be revised to cover the allocation of broadcasting spectrum. (Which, in fact, rather resembles what is being attempted here.) We will need to develop an entirely new set of methods as befits this entirely new set of circumstances.

Most of the people who actually create soft property--the programmers, hackers, and Net surfers--already know this. Unfortunately, neither the companies they work for nor the lawyers these companies hire have enough direct experience with immaterial goods to understand why they are so problematic. They are proceeding as though the old laws can somehow be made to work, either by grotesque expansion or by force. They are wrong.

The source of this conundrum is as simple as its solution is complex. Digital technology is detaching information from the physical plane, where property law of all sorts has always found definition.

Throughout the history of copyrights and patents, the proprietary assertions of thinkers have been focused not on their ideas but on the expression of those ideas. The ideas themselves, as well as facts about the phenomena of the world, were considered to be the collective property of humanity. One could claim franchise, in the case of copyright, on the precise turn of phrase used to convey a particular idea or the order in which facts were presented.

The point at which this franchise was imposed was that moment when the "word became flesh" by departing the mind of its originator and entering some physical object, whether book or widget. The subsequent arrival of other commercial media besides books didn't alter the legal importance of this moment. Law protected expression and, with few (and recent) exceptions, to express was to make physical.

Protecting physical expression had the force of convenience on its side. Copyright worked well because, Gutenberg notwithstanding, it was hard to make a book. Furthermore, books froze their contents into a condition which was as challenging to alter as it was to reproduce. Counterfeiting or distributing counterfeit volumes were obvious and visible activities, easy enough to catch somebody in the act of doing. Finally, unlike unbounded words or images, books had material surfaces to which one could attach copyright notices, publisher's marques, and price tags.

Mental to physical conversion was even more central to patent. A patent, until recently, was either a description of the form into which materials were to be rendered in the service of some purpose or a description of the process by which rendition occurred. In either case, the conceptual heart of patent was the material result. If no purposeful object could be rendered due to some material limitation, the patent was rejected. Neither a Klein bottle nor a shovel made of silk could be patented. It had to be a thing and the thing had to work.

Thus the rights of invention and authorship adhered to activities in the physical world. One didn't get paid for ideas but for the ability to deliver them into reality. For all practical purposes, the value was in the conveyance and not the thought conveyed.

In other words, the bottle was protected, not the wine.

Now, as information enters Cyberspace, the native home of Mind, these bottles are vanishing. With the advent of digitization, it is now possible to replace all previous information storage forms with one meta-bottle: complex--and highly liquid--patterns of ones and zeros.

Even the physical/digital bottles to which we've become accustomed, floppy disks, CD-ROM's, and other discrete, shrink-wrappable bit-packages, will disappear as all computers jack in to the global Net. While the Internet may never include every single CPU on the planet, it is more than doubling every year and can be expected to become the principal medium of information conveyance if, eventually, the only one.

Once that has happened, all the goods of the Information Age--all of the expressions once contained in books or film strips or records or newsletters--will exist either as pure thought or something very much like thought: voltage conditions darting around the Net at the speed of light, in conditions which one might behold in effect, as glowing pixels or transmitted sounds, but never touch or claim to "own" in the old sense of the word.

Some might argue that information will still require some physical manifestation, such as its magnetic existence on the titanic hard disks of distant servers, but these are bottles which have no macroscopically discrete or personally meaningful form.

Some will also argue that we have been dealing with unbottled expression since the advent of radio, and they would be right. But for most of the history of broadcast, there was no convenient way to capture soft goods from the electromagnetic ether and reproduce them in anything like the quality available in commercial packages. Only recently has this changed and little has been done legally or technically to address the change.

Generally, the issue of consumer payment for broadcast products was irrelevant. The consumers themselves were the product. Broadcast media were supported either by selling the attention of their audience to advertisers, using government to assess payment through taxes, or the whining mendicancy of annual donor drives.

All of the broadcast support models are flawed. Support either by advertisers or government has almost invariably tainted the purity of the goods delivered. Besides, direct marketing is gradually killing the advertiser support model anyway.

Broadcast media gave us a another payment method for a virtual product in the royalties which broadcasters pay songwriters through such organizations as ASCAP and BMI. But, as a member of ASCAP, I can assure you this is not a model which we should emulate. The monitoring methods are wildly approximate. There is no parallel system of accounting in the revenue stream. It doesn't really work. Honest.

In any case, without our old methods of physically defining the expression of ideas, and in the absence of successful new models for non-physical transaction, we simply don't know how to assure reliable payment for mental works. To make matters worse, this comes at a time when the human mind is replacing sunlight and mineral deposits as the principal source of new wealth.

Furthermore, the increasing difficulty of enforcing existing copyright and patent laws is already placing in peril the ultimate source of intellectual property, the free exchange of ideas.

That is, when the primary articles of commerce in a society look so much like speech as to be indistinguishable from it, and when the traditional methods of protecting their ownership have become ineffectual, attempting to fix the problem with broader and more vigorous enforcement will inevitably threaten freedom of speech.

The greatest constraint on your future liberties may come not from government but from corporate legal departments laboring to protect by force what can no longer be protected by practical efficiency or general social consent.

Furthermore, when Jefferson and his fellow creatures of The Enlightenment designed the system which became American copyright law, their primary objective was assuring the widespread distribution of thought, not profit. Profit was the fuel which would carry ideas into the libraries and minds of their new republic. Libraries would purchase books, thus rewarding the authors for their work in assembling ideas, which otherwise "incapable of confinement" would then become freely available to the public. But what is the role of libraries in the absense of books? How does society now pay for the distribution of ideas if not by charging for the ideas themselves?

Additionally complicating the matter is the fact that along with the physical bottles in which intellectual property protection has resided, digital technology is also erasing the legal jurisdictions of the physical world, and replacing them with the unbounded and perhaps permanently lawless seas of Cyberspace.

In Cyberspace, there are not only no national or local boundaries to contain the scene of a crime and determine the method of its prosecution, there are no clear cultural agreements on what a crime might be. Unresolved and basic differences between European and Asian cultural assumptions about intellectual property can only be exacerbated in a region where many transactions are taking place in both hemispheres and yet, somehow, in neither.

Even in the most local of digital conditions, jurisdiction and responsibility are hard to assess. A group of music publishers filed suit against Compuserve this fall for it having allowed its users to upload musical compositions into areas where other users might get them. But since Compuserve cannot practically exercise much control over the flood of bits which pass between its subscribers, it probably shouldn't be held responsible for unlawfully "publishing" these works.

Notions of property, value, ownership, and the nature of wealth itself are changing more fundamentally than at any time since the Sumerians first poked cuneiform into wet clay and called it stored grain. Only a very few people are aware of the enormity of this shift and fewer of them are lawyers or public officials.

Those who do see these changes must prepare responses for the legal and social confusion which will erupt as efforts to protect new forms of property with old methods become more obviously futile, and, as a consequence, more adamant.

>From Swords to Writs to Bits

Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economy primarily based on goods which take no material form. In doing so, we may be eliminating any predictable connection between creators and a fair reward for the utility or pleasure others may find in their works.

Without that connection, and without a fundamental change in consciousness to accommodate its loss, we are building our future on furor, litigation, and institutionalized evasion of payment except in response to raw force. We may return to the Bad Old Days of property.

Throughout the darker parts of human history, the possession and distribution of property was a largely military matter. "Ownership" was assured those with the nastiest tools, whether fists or armies, and the most resolute will to use them. Property was the divine right of thugs.

By the turn of the First Millennium A.D., the emergence of merchant classes and landed gentry forced the development of ethical understandings for the resolution of property disputes. In the late Middle Ages, enlightened rulers like England's Henry II began to codify this unwritten "common law"into recorded canons. These laws were local, but this didn't matter much as they were primarily directed at real estate, a form of property which is local by definition. And which, as the name implied, was very real.

This continued to be the case as long as the origin of wealth was agricultural, but with dawning of the Industrial Revolution, humanity began to focus as much on means as ends. Tools acquired a new social value and, thanks to their own development, it became possible to duplicate and distribute them in quantity.

To encourage their invention, copyright and patent law were developed in most western countries. These laws were devoted to the delicate task of getting mental creations into the world where they could be used--and enter the minds of others--while assuring their inventors compensation for the value of their use. And, as previously stated, the systems of both law and practice which grew up around that task were based on physical expression.

Since it is now possible to convey ideas from one mind to another without ever making them physical, we are now claiming to own ideas themselves and not merely their expression. And since it is likewise now possible to create useful tools which never take physical form. we have taken to patenting abstractions, sequences of virtual events, and mathematical formulae--the most un-real estate imaginable.

In certain areas, this leaves rights of ownership in such an ambiguous condition that once again property adheres to those who can muster the largest armies. The only difference is that this time the armies consist of lawyers.

Threatening their opponents with the endless Purgatory of litigation, over which some might prefer death itself, they assert claim to any thought which might have entered another cranium within the collective body of the corporations they serve. They act as though these ideas appeared in splendid detachment from all previous human thought. And they pretend that thinking about a product is somehow as good as manufacturing, distributing, and selling it.

What was previously considered a common human resource, distributed among the minds and libraries of the world, as well as the phenomena of nature herself, is now being fenced and deeded. It is as though a new class of enterprise had arisen which claimed to own air and water.

What is to be done? While there is a certain grim fun to be had in it, dancing on the grave of copyright and patent will solve little, especially when so few are willing to admit that the occupant of this grave is even deceased and are trying to up by force what can no longer be upheld by popular consent.

The legalists, desperate over their slipping grip, are vigorously trying to extend it. Indeed, the United States and other proponants of GATT are making are making adherance to to our moribund systems of intellectual property protection a condition of membership in the marketplace of nations. For example, China will be denied Most Favored nation trading status unless they agree to uphold a set of cuturally alien principles which are no longer even sensibly applicable in their country of origin.

In a more perfect world, we'd be wise to declare a moratorium on litigation, legislation, and international treaties in this area until we had a clearer sense of the terms and conditions of enterprise in Cyberspace. Ideally, laws ratify already developed social consensus. They are less the Social Contract itself than a series of memoranda expressing a collective intent which has emerged out of many millions of human interactions.

Humans have not inhabited Cyberspace long enough or in sufficient diversity to have developed a Social Contract which conforms to the strange new conditions of that world. Laws developed prior to consensus usually serve the already established few who can get them passed and not society as a whole.

To the extent that either law or established social practice exists in this area, they are already in dangerous disagreement. The laws regarding unlicensed reproduction of commercial software are clear and stern...and rarely observed. Software piracy laws are so practically unenforceable and breaking them has become so socially acceptable that only a thin minority appears compelled, either by fear or conscience, to obey them.

I sometimes give speeches on this subject, and I always ask how many people in the audience can honestly claim to have no unauthorized software on their hard disks. I've never seen more than ten percent of the hands go up.

Whenever there is such profound divergence between the law and social practice, it is not society that adapts. And, against the swift tide of custom, the Software Publishers' current practice of hanging a few visible scapegoats is so obviously capricious as to only further diminish respect for the law.

Part of the widespread popular disregard for commercial software copyrights stems from a legislative failure to understand the conditions into which it was inserted. To assume that systems of law based in the physical world will serve in an environment which is as fundamentally different as Cyberspace is a folly for which everyone doing business in the future will pay.

As I will discuss in the next segment, unbounded intellectual property is very different from physical property and can no longer be protected as though these differences did not exist. For example, if we continue to assume that value is based on scarcity, as it is with regard to physical objects, we will create laws which are precisely contrary to the nature of information, which may, in many cases, increase in value with distribution.

The large, legally risk-averse institutions most likely to play by the old rules will suffer for their compliance. The more lawyers, guns, and money they invest in either protecting their rights or subverting those of their opponents, the more commercial competition will resemble the Kwakiutl Potlatch Ceremony, in which adversaries competed by destroying their own possessions. Their ability to produce new technology will simply grind to a halt as every move they make drives them deeper into a tar pit of courtroom warfare.

Faith in law will not be an effective strategy for high tech companies. Law adapts by continuous increments and at a pace second only to geology in its stateliness. Technology advances in the lunging jerks, like the punctuation of biological evolution grotesquely accelerated. Real world conditions will continue to change at a blinding pace, and the law will get further behind, more profoundly confused. This mismatch is permanent.

Promising economies based on purely digital products will either be born in a state of paralysis, as appears to be the case with multimedia, or continue in a brave and willful refusal by their owners to play the ownership game at all.

In the United States one can already see a parallel economy developing, mostly among small fast moving enterprises who protect their ideas by gettin g into the marketplace quicker then their larger competitors who base their protection on fear and litigation.

Perhaps those who are part of the problem will simply quarantine themselves in court while those who are part of the solution will create a new society based, at first, on piracy and freebooting. It may well be that when the current system of intellectual property law has collapsed, as seems inevitable, that no new legal structure will arise in its place.

But something will happen. After all, people do business. When a currency becomes meaningless, business is done in barter. When societies develop outside the law, they develop their own unwritten codes, practices, and ethical systems. While technology may undo law, technology offers methods for restoring creative rights.

A Taxonomy of Information

It seems to me that the most productive thing to do now is to look hard into the true nature of what we're trying to protect. How much do we really know about information and its natural behaviors?

What are the essential characteristics of unbounded creation? How does it differ from previous forms of property? How many of our assumptions about it have actually been about its containers rather than their mysterious contents? What are its different species and how does each of them lend itself to control? What technologies will be useful in creating new virtual bottles to replace the old physical ones?

Of course, information is, by its nature, intangible and hard to define. Like other such deep phenomena as light or matter, it is a natural host to paradox. And as it is most helpful to understand light as being both a particle and a wave, an understanding of information may emerge in the abstract congruence of its several different properties which might be described by the following three statements:

€ Information is an activity.

€ Information is a life form.

€ Information is a relationship.

In the following section, I will examine each of these.

I. INFORMATION IS AN ACTIVITY

Information Is a Verb, Not a Noun.

Freed of its containers, information is obviously not a thing. In fact, it is something which happens in the field of interaction between minds or objects or other pieces of information.

Gregory Bateson, expanding on the information theory of Claude Shannon, said, "Information is a difference which makes a difference." Thus, information only really exists in the  \[delta\]. The making of that difference is an activity within a relationship. Information is an action which occupies time rather than a state of being which occupies physical space, as is the case with hard goods. It is the pitch, not the baseball, the dance, not the dancer.

Information Is Experienced, Not Possessed

Even when it has been encapsulated in some static form like a book or a hard disk, information is still something which happens to you as you mentally decompress it from its storage code. But, whether it's running at gigabits per second or words per minute, the actual decoding is a process which must be performed by and upon a mind, a process which must take place in time.

There was a cartoon in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists a few years ago which illustrated this point beautifully. In the drawing, a holdup man trains his gun on the sort of bespectacled fellow you'd figure might have a lot of information stored in his head. "Quick," orders the bandit, "Give me all your ideas."

Information Has To Move

Sharks are said to die of suffocation if they stop swimming, and the same is nearly true of information. Information which isn't moving ceases to exist as anything but potential...at least until it is allowed to move again. For this reason, the practice of information hoarding, common in bureaucracies, is an especially wrong-headed artifact of physically-based value systems.

Information is Conveyed by Propagation, Not Distribution

The way in which information spreads is also very different from the distribution of physical goods. It moves more like something from nature than from a factory. It can concatenate like falling dominos or grow in the usual fractal lattice, like frost spreading on a window, but it cannot be shipped around like widgets, except to the extent that it can be contained in them. It doesn't simply move on. It leaves a trail of itself everywhere it's been.

The central economic distinction between information and physical property is the ability of information to be transferred without leaving the possession of the original owner. If I sell you my horse, I can't ride him after that. If I sell you what I know, we both know it.

II. INFORMATION IS A LIFE FORM

Information wants to be free.

Stewart Brand is generally credited with this elegant statement of the obvious, recognizing both the natural desire of secrets to be told and the fact that they might be capable of possessing something like a "desire" in the first place.

English Biologist and Philosopher Richard Dawkins proposed the idea of "memes," self-replicating, patterns of information which propagate themselves across the ecologies of mind, saying they were like life forms.

I believe they are life forms in every respect but a basis in the carbon atom. They self-reproduce, they interact with their surroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist. Like any other life form they evolve to fill the possibility spaces of their local environments, which are, in this case the surrounding belief systems and cultures of their hosts, namely, us.

Indeed, the sociobiologists like Dawkins make a plausible case that carbon-based life forms are information as well, that, as the chicken is an egg's way of making another egg, the entire biological spectacle is just the DNA molecule's means of copying out more information strings exactly like itself.

Information Replicates into the Cracks of Possibility

Like DNA helices, ideas are relentless expansionists, always seeking new opportunities for lebensraum. And, as in carbon-based nature, the more robust organisms are extremely adept at finding new places to live. Thus, just as the common housefly has insinuated itself into practically every ecosystem on the planet, so has the meme of "life after death" found a niche in most minds, or psycho-ecologies.

The more universally resonant an idea or image or song , the more minds it will enter and remain within. Trying to stop the spread of a really robust piece of information is about as easy as keeping killer bees South of the Border. The stuff just leaks.

Information Wants To Change

If ideas and other interactive patterns of information are indeed life forms, they can be expected to evolve constantly into forms which will be more perfectly adapted to their surroundings. And, as we see, they are doing this all the time.

But for a long time, our static media, whether carvings in stone, ink on paper, or dye on celluloid, have strongly resisted the evolutionary impulse, exalting as a consequence the author's ability to determine the finished product. But, as in an oral tradition, digitized information has no "final cut."

Digital information, unconstrained by packaging, is a continuing process more like the metamorphosing tales of prehistory than anything which will fit in shrink wrap. From the Neolithic to Gutenberg, information was passed on, mouth to ear, changing with every re-telling (or re-singing). The stories which once shaped our sense of the world didn't have authoritative versions. They adapted to each culture in which they found themselves being told.

Because there was never a moment when the story was frozen in print, the so-called "moral" right of storytellers to keep the tale their own was neither protected nor recognized. The story simply passed through each of them on its way to the next, where it would assume a different form. As we return to continuous information, we can expect the importance of authorship to diminish. Creative people may have to renew their acquaintance with humility.

But our system of copyright makes no accomodation whatever for expressions which don't at some point become "fixed" nor for cultural expressions which lack a specific author or inventor.

Jazz improvizations, standup comedy routines, mime performances, developing monologues, and unrecorded broadcast transmissions all lack the Constitutional requirement of fixation as a "writing". Without being fixed by a point of publicatoin the liquid works of the future will all look more like these continuously adapting and changing forms and will therefore exist beyond the reach of copyright.

Copyright expert Pamela Samuelson tells of having attended a conference last year convened around the fact that Western countries may legally appropriate the music, designs, and biomedical lore of aboriginal people without compensation to their tribe of origin since that tribe is not an "author" or "inventor."

But soon most information will be generated collaboratively by the cyber-tribal hunter-gatherers of Cyberspace. Our arrogant legal dismissal of the rights of "primitives" will be back to haunt us soon.

Information is Perishable

With the exception of the rare classic, most information is like farm produce. Its quality degrades rapidly both over time and in distance from the source of production. But even here, value is highly subjective and conditional. Yesterday's papers are quite valuable to the historian. In fact, the older they are, the more valuable they become. On the other hand, a commodities broker might consider news of an event which is more than an hour old to have lost any relevance.

III. INFORMATION IS A RELATIONSHIP

Meaning Has Value and Is Unique to Each Case

In most cases, we assign value to information based on its meaningfulness. The place where information dwells, the holy moment where transmission becomes reception, is a region which has many shifting characteristics and flavors depending on the relationship of sender and receiver, the depth of their interactivity.

Each such relationship is unique. Even in cases where the sender is a broadcast medium, and no response is returned, the receiver is hardly passive. Receiving information is often as creative an act as generating it.

The value of what is sent depends entirely on the extent to which each individual receiver has the receptors...shared terminology, attention, interest, language, paradigm...necessary to render what is received meaningful.

Understanding is a critical element increasingly overlooked in the effort to turn information into a commodity. Data may be any set of facts, useful or not, intelligible or inscrutable, germane or irrelevant. Computers can crank out new data all night long without human help, and the results may be offered for sale as information. They may or may not actually be so. Only a human being can recognize the meaning which separates information from data.

In fact, information, in the economic sense of the word, consists of data which have been passed through a particular human mind and found meaningful within that mental context. One fella's information is all just data to someone else. If you're an anthropologist, my detailed charts of Tasaday kinship patterns might be critical information to you. If you're a banker from Hong Kong, they might barely seem to be data.

Familiarity Has More Value Than Scarcity,

With physical goods, there is a direct correlation between scarcity and value. Gold is more valuable than wheat, even though you can't eat it. While this is not always the case, the situation with information is usually precisely the reverse. Most soft goods increase in value as they become more common. Familiarity is an important asset in the world of information. It may often be the case that the best thing you can do to raise the demand for your product is to give it away.

While this has not always worked with shareware, it could be argued that there is a connection between the extent to which commercial software is pirated and the amount which gets sold. Broadly pirated software, such as Lotus 1-2-3 or WordPerfect, becomes a standard and benefits from Law of Increasing Returns based on familiarity.

In regard to my own soft product, rock and roll songs, there is no question that the band I write them for, the Grateful Dead, has increased its popularity enormously by giving them away. We have been letting people tape our concerts since the early seventies, but instead of reducing the demand for our product, we are now the largest concert draw in America, a fact which is at least in part attributable to the popularity generated by those tapes.

True, I don't get any royalties on the millions of copies of my songs which have been extracted from concerts, but I see no reason to complain. The fact is, no one but the Grateful Dead can perform a Grateful Dead song, so if you want the experience and not its thin projection, you have to buy a ticket from us. In other words, our intellectual property protection derives from our being the only real-time source of it.

Exclusivity Has Value

The problem with a model which turns the physical scarcity/value ratio on its head is that sometimes the value of information is very much based on its scarcity. Exclusive possession of certain facts makes them more useful. If everyone knows about conditions which might drive a stock price up, the information is valueless.

But again, the critical factor is usually time. It doesn't matter if this kind of information eventually becomes ubiquitous. What matters is being among the first who possess it and act on it. While potent secrets usually don't stay secret, they may remain so long enough to advance the cause of their original holders.

Point of View and Authority Have Value

In a world of floating realities and contradictory maps, rewards will accrue to those commentators whose maps seem to fit their territory snugly, based on their ability to yield predictable results for those who use them.

In aesthetic information, whether poetry or rock 'n' roll, people are willing to buy the new product of an artist, sight-unseen, based on their having been delivered a pleasurable experience by previous work.

Reality is an edit. People are willing to pay for the authority of those editors whose filtering point of view seems to fit best. And again, point of view is an asset which cannot be stolen or duplicated. No one but Esther Dyson sees the world as she does and the handsome fee she charges for her newsletter is actually for the privilege of looking at the world through her unique eyes.

Time Replaces Space

In the physical world, value depends heavily on possession, or proximity in space. One owns that material which falls inside certain dimensional boundaries and the ability to act directly, exclusively, and as one wishes upon what falls inside those boundaries is the principal right of ownership. And of course there is the relationship between value and scarcity, a limitation in space.

In the virtual world, proximity in time is a value determinant. An informational product is generally more valuable the closer the purchaser can place himself to the moment of its expression, a limitation in time. Many kinds of information degrade rapidly with either time or reproduction. Relevance fades as the territory they map changes. Noise is introduced and bandwidth lost with passage away from the point where the information is first produced. Thus, listening to a Grateful Dead tape is hardly the same experience as attending a Grateful Dead concert. The closer one can get to the headwaters of an informational stream, the better his changes of finding an accurate picture of reality in it. In an era of easy reproduction, the informational abstractions of popular experiences will propagate out from their source moments to reach anyone who's interested. But it's easy enough to restrict the real experience of the desirable event, whether knock-out punch or guitar lick, to those willing to pay for being there.

The Protection of Execution

In the hick town I come from, they don't give you much credit for just having ideas. You are judged by what you can make of them. As things continue to speed up, I think we see that execution is the best protection for those designs which become physical products. Or, as Steve Jobs once put it, "Real artists ship." The big winner is usually the one who gets to the market first (and with enough organizational force to keep the lead).

But, as we become fixated upon information commerce, many of us seem to think that originality alone is sufficient to convey value, deserving, with the right legal assurances, of a steady wage. In fact, the best way to protect intellectual property is to act on it. It's not enough to invent and patent, one has to innovate as well. Someone claims to have patented the microprocessor before Intel. Maybe so. If he'd actually started shipping microprocessors before Intel, his claim would seem far less spurious.

Information as Its Own Reward

It is now a commonplace to say that money is information. With the exception of Krugerands, crumpled cab-fare, and the contents of those suit-cases which drug lords are reputed to carry, most of the money in the informatized world is in ones and zeros. The global money supply sloshes around the Net, as fluid as weather. It is also obvious, as I have discussed, that information has become as fundamental to the creation of modern wealth as land and sunlight once were.

What is less obvious is the extent to which information is acquiring intrinsic value, not as a means to acquisition but as the object to be acquired. I suppose this has always been less explicitly the case. In politics and academia, potency and information have always been closely related.

However, as we increasingly buy information with money, we begin to see that buying information with other information is simple economic exchange without the necessity of converting the product into and out of currency. This is somewhat challenging for those who like clean accounting, since, information theory aside, informational exchange rates are too squishy to quantify to the decimal point.

Nevertheless, most of what a middle class American purchases has little to do with survival. We buy beauty, prestige, experience, education, and all the obscure pleasures of owning. Many of these things can not only be expressed in non-material terms, they can be acquired by non-material means.

And then there are the inexplicable pleasures of information itself, the joys of learning, knowing, and teaching. The strange good feeling of information coming into and out of oneself. Playing with ideas is a recreation which people must be willing to pay a lot for, given the market for books and elective seminars. We'd likely spend even more money for such pleasures if there weren't so many opportunities to pay for ideas with other ideas.

This explains much of the collective "volunteer" work which fills the archives, newsgroups, and databases of the Internet. Its denizens are not working for 'nothing," as is widely believed. Rather they are getting paid in something besides money. It is an economy which consists almost entirely of information.

This may become the dominant form of human trade, and if we persist in modeling economics on a strictly monetary basis, we may be gravely misled.

Getting Paid in Cyberspace

How all the foregoing relates to solutions to the crisis in intellectual property is something I've barely started to wrap my mind around. It's fairly paradigm-warping to look at information through fresh eyes--to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies, to imagine the tottering travesties of case law we will stack up if we go on treating it legally as though it were.

As I've said, I believe these towers of outmoded boilerplate will be a smoking heap sometime in the next decade and we mind miners will have no choice but to cast our lot with new systems that work.

I'm not really so gloomy about our prospects as readers of this jeremiad so far might conclude. Solutions will emerge. Nature abhors a vacuum and so does commerce.

Indeed, one of the aspects of the electronic frontier which I have always found most appealing--and the reason Mitch Kapor and I used that phrase in naming our foundation--is the degree to which it resembles the 19th Century American West in its natural preference for social devices which emerge from it conditions rather than those which are imposed from the outside.

Until the west was fully settled and "civilized" in this century, order was established according to an unwritten Code of the West which had the fluidity of etiquette rather than the rigidity of law. Ethics were more important than rules. Understandings were preferred over laws, which were, in any event, largely unenforceable.

I believe that law, as we understand it, was developed to protect the interests which arose in the two economic "waves" which Alvin Toffler accurately identified in The Third Wave. The First Wave was agriculturally based and required law to order ownership of the principal source of production, land. In the Second Wave, manufacturing became the economic mainspring, and the structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions which needed protection for their reserves of capital, manpower, and hardware.

Both of these economic systems required stability. Their laws were designed to resist change and to assure some equability of distribution within a fairly static social framework. The possibility spaces had to be constrained to preserve the predictability necessary to either land stewardship or capital formation.

In the Third Wave we have now entered, information to a large extent replaces land, capital, and hardware, and as I have detailed in the preceding section, information is most at home in a much more fluid and adaptable environment. The Third Wave is likely to bring a fundamental shift in the purposes and methods of law which will affect far more than simply those statutes which govern intellectual property.

The "terrain" itself--the architecture of the Net--may come to serve many of the purposes which could only be maintained in the past by legal imposition. For example, it may be unnecessary to constitutionally assure freedom of expression in an environment which, in the words of my fellow EFF co-founder John Gilmore, "treats censorship as a malfunction" and re-routes proscribed ideas around it.

Similar natural balancing mechanisms may arise to smooth over the social discontinuities which previously required legal intercession to set right. On the Net, these differences are more likely to be spanned by a continuous spectrum which connects as much as it separates.

And, despite their fierce grip on the old legal structure, companies which trade in information are likely to find that in their increasing inability to deal sensibly with technological issues, the courts will not produce results which are predictable enough to be supportive of long-term enterprise. Every litigation becomes like a game of Russian roulette, depending on the depth the presiding judge's clue-impairment.

Uncodified or adaptive "law," while as "fast, loose, and out of control" as other emergent forms, is probably more likely to yield something like justice at this point. In fact, one can already see in development new practices to suit the conditions of virtual commerce. The life forms of information are evolving methods to protect their continued reproduction.

For example, while all the tiny print on a commercial diskette envelope punctiliously requires much of those who would open it, there are, as I say, few who read those provisos, let alone follow them to the letter. And yet, the software business remains a very healthy sector of the American economy.

Why is this? Because people seem to eventually buy the software they really use. Once a program becomes central to your work, you want the latest version of it, the best support, the actual manuals, all privileges which are attached to ownership. Such practical considerations will, in the absence of working law, become more and more important in important in getting paid for what might easily be obtained for nothing.

I do think that some software is being purchased in the service of ethics or the abstract awareness that the failure to buy it will result in its not being produced any longer, but I'm going to leave those motivators aside. While I believe that the failure of law will almost certainly result in a compensating re-emergence of ethics as the ordering template of society, this is a belief I don't have room to support here.

Instead, I think that, as in the case cited above, compensation for soft products will be driven primarily by practical considerations, all of them consistent with the true properties of digital information, where the value lies in it, and how it can be both manipulated and protected by technology.

While the conundrum remains a conundrum, I can begin to see the directions from which solutions may emerge, based in part on broadening those practical solutions which are already in practice.

Relationship and Its Tools

I believe one idea is central to understanding liquid commerce: Information economics, in the absence of objects, will be based more on relationship than possession.

One existing model for the future conveyance of intellectual property is real time performance, a medium currently used only in theater, music, lectures, stand-up comedy and pedagogy. I believe the concept of performance will expand to include most of the information economy from multi-casted soap operas to stock analysis. In these instances, commercial exchange will be more like ticket sales to a continuous show than the purchase of discrete bundles of that which is being shown.

The other model, of course, is service. The entire professional class--doctors, lawyers, consultants, architects, etc.--are already being paid directly for their intellectual property. Who needs copyright when you're on a retainer?

In fact, this model was applied to much of what is now copyrighted until the late 18th Century. Before the industrialization of creation, writers, composers, artists, and the like produced their products in the private service of patrons. Without objects to distribute in a mass market, creative people will return to a condition somewhat like this, except that they will serve many patrons, rather than one.

We can already see the emergence of companies which base their existence on supporting and enhancing the soft property they create rather than selling it by the shrink-wrapped piece or embedding it in widgets.

Trip Hawkins' new company for creating and licensing multimedia tools, 3DO, is an example of what I'm talking about. 3DO doesn't intend to produce any commercial software or consumer devices. Instead, they will act as a kind of private standards setting body, mediating among software and device creators who will be their licensees. They will provide a point of commonalty for relationships between a broad spectrum of entities.

In any case, whether you think of yourself as a service provider or a performer, the future protection of your intellectual property will depend on your ability to control your relationship to the market--a relationship which will most likely live and grow over a period of time.

The value of that relationship will reside in the quality of performance, the uniqueness of your point of view, the validity of your expertise, its relevance to your market, and, underlying everything, the ability of that market to access your creative services swiftly, conveniently, and interactively.

Interaction and Protection

Direct interaction will provide a lot of intellectual property protection in the future, and, indeed, it already has. No one knows how many software pirates have bought legitimate copies of a program after calling its publisher for technical support and being asked for some proof of purchase, but I would guess the number is very high.

The same kind of controls will be applicable to "question and answer"relationships between authorities (or artists) and those who seek their expertise. Newsletters, magazines, and books will be supplemented by the ability of their subscribers to ask direct questions of authors.

Interactivity will be a billable commodity even in the absence of authorship. As people move into the Net and increasingly get their information directly from its point of production, unfiltered by centralized media, they will attempt to develop the same interactive ability to probe reality which only experience has provided them in the past. Live access to these distant "eyes and ears" will be much easier to cordon than access to static bundles of stored but easily reproducible information.

In most cases, control will be based on restricting access to the freshest, highest bandwidth information. It will be a matter of defining the ticket, the venue, the performer, and the identity of the ticket holder, definitions which I believe will take their forms from technology, not law.

In most cases, the defining technology will be cryptography.

Crypto Bottling

Cryptography, as I've said perhaps too many times, is the "material" from which the walls, boundaries--and bottles--of Cyberspace will be fashioned.

Of course there are problems with cryptography or any other purely technical method of property protection. It has always appeared to me that the more security you hide your goods behind, the more likely you are to turn your sanctuary into a target. Having come from a place where people leave their keys in their cars and don't even have keys to their houses, I remain convinced that the best obstacle to crime is a society with its ethics intact.

While I admit that this is not the kind of society most of us live in, I also believe that a social over-reliance on protection by barricades rather than conscience will eventually wither the latter by turning intrusion and theft into a sport, rather than a crime. This is already occurring in the digital domain as is evident in the activities of computer crackers.

Furthermore, I would argue that initial efforts to protect digital copyright by copy protection contributed to the current condition in which most otherwise ethical computer users seem morally untroubled by their possession of pirated software.

Instead of cultivating among the newly computerized a sense of respect for the work of their fellows, early reliance on copy protection led to the subliminal notion that cracking into a software package somehow "earned"one the right to use it. Limited not by conscience but by technical skill, many soon felt free to do whatever they could get away with. This will continue to be a potential liability of the encryption of digitized commerce.

Furthermore, it's cautionary to remember that copy protection was rejected by the market in most areas. Many of the upcoming efforts to use cryptography-based protection schemes will probably suffer the same fate. People are not going to tolerate much which makes computers harder to use than they already are without any benefit to the user.

Nevertheless, encryption has already demonstrated a certain blunt utility. New subscriptions to various commercial satellite TV services sky-rocketed recently after their deployment of more robust encryption of their feeds. This, despite a booming backwoods trade in black decoder chips conducted by folks who'd look more at home running moonshine than cracking code.

Another obvious problem with encryption as a global solution is that once something has been unscrambled by a legitimate licensee, it may be openly available to massive reproduction.

In some instances, reproduction following decryption may not be a problem. Many soft products degrade sharply in value with time. It may be that the only real interest in some such products will be among those who have purchased the keys to immediacy.

Furthermore, as software becomes more modular and distribution moves online, it will begin to metamorphose in direct interaction with its user base. Discontinuous upgrades will smooth into a constant process of incremental improvement and adaptation, some of it man-made and some of it arising through genetic algorithms. Pirated copies of software may become too static to have much value to anyone.

Even in cases such as images, where the information is expected to remain fixed, the unencrypted file could still be interwoven with code which could continue to protect it by a wide variety of means.

In most of the schemes I can project, the file would be "alive" with permanently embedded software which could "sense" the surrounding conditions and interact with them, For example, it might contain code which could detect the process of duplication and cause it to self-destruct.

Other methods might give the file the ability to "phone home" through the Net to its original owner. The continued integrity of some files might require periodic "feeding" with digital cash from their host, which they would then relay back to their authors.

Of course files which possess the independent ability to communicate upstream sound uncomfortably like the Morris Internet Worm. "Live" files do have a certain viral quality. And serious privacy issues would arise if everyone's computer were packed with digital spies.

The point is that cryptography will enable a lot of protection technologies which will develop rapidly in the obsessive competition which has always existed between lock-makers and lock-breakers.

But cryptography will not be used simply for making locks. It is also at the heart of both digital signatures and the afore-mentioned digital cash, both of which I believe will be central to the future protection of intellectual property.

I believe that the generally acknowledged failure of the shareware model in software had less to do with dishonesty than with the simple inconvenience of paying for shareware. If the payment process can be automated, as digital cash and signature will make possible, I believe that soft product creators will reap a much higher return from the bread they cast upon the waters of Cyberspace.

Moreover, they will be spared much of the overhead which presently adheres to the marketing, manufacture, sales, and distribution of information products, whether those products are computer programs, books, CD's, or motion pictures. This will reduce prices and further increase the likelihood of non-compulsory payment.

But of course there is a fundamental problem with a system which requires, through technology, payment for every access to a particular expression. It defeats the original Jeffersonian purpose of seeing that ideas were available to everyone regardless of their economic station. I am not comfortable with a model which will restrict inquiry to the wealthy.

An Economy of Verbs

The future forms and protections of intellectual property are densely obscured from the entrance to the Virtual Age. Nevertheless, I can make (or reiterate) a few flat statements which I earnestly believe won't look too silly in fifty years.

€ In the absence of the old containers, almost everything we think we know about intellectual property is wrong. We are going to have to unlearn it. We are going to have to look at information as though we'd never seen the stuff before.

€ The protections which we will develop will rely far more on ethics and technology than on law.

€ Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual property protection. (And should, for this and other reasons, be made more widely available.)

€ The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather than possession. It will be continuous rather than sequential.

And finally, in the years to come, most human exchange will be virtual rather than physical, consisting not of stuff but the stuff of which dreams are made. Our future business will be conducted in a world made more of verbs than nouns.

The thoughts in it have not been "mine" alone but have assembled themselves in a field of interaction which has existed between myself and numerous others, to whom I am grateful. They particularly include: Pamela Samuelson, Kevin Kelly, Mitch Kapor, Mike Godwin, Stewart Brand, Mike Holderness, Miram Barlow, Danny Hillis, Trip Hawkins, and Alvin Toffler.

However, I should note in honesty that when Wired sends me a check for having temporarily "fixed" it on their pages, I alone will cash it...

A Little Light

With Brent Mydland.  Recorded on Built To Last (Arista Records, 1989) .

Martinez, California   January 27, 1989

Well, there ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care.

And it isn't even lonely when no one's ever there.

I had a lot of dreams once, but some of them came true...

The honey's sometimes bitter when fortune falls on you.

So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night.

And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright.

But here you're trembling like a sparrow, I will try with all my might

To give you just a little sweetness...

Just a little sweetness...

Just a little light.

I have always heard that virtue ought be its own reward,

But it never comes so easy when you're living by the sword.

It's even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way.

You're as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away.

Even though I been a stranger, full of irony and spite

Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright,

Something shines around you and it seems, to my delight

To give me just a little sweetness...

Just a little sweetness...

Just a little sweetness...

Just a little light.

Bridge:

This could be just another highway, coiled up in the night.

You could be just another white-tail, baby, stranded on my brights,

There's a tingling recognition

Like the sound of distant thunder

And I begin to wonder

If the love I've driven under

Won't ignite.

Instrumental

So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night.

And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright.

Something shines around you that seems, to my delight

To give me just a little sweetness...

Just a little sweetness...

Just a little sweetness...

Just a little light.

Blow Away

With Brent Mydland.  Recorded on Built To Last (Arista Records, 1989) .

Martinez, California   February, 1988

A man and a woman come together

as strangers.

When they part they're usually

strangers still.

It's like a practical joke

played on us by our Maker.

Empty bottles,

that can't be filled.

You fancy me to be the master

of your feelings.

You barely bruise me

with your looks to kill.

Though I admit we were sometimes brutal

in our dealings,

I never held you against your will.

Chorus:

Baby, who's to say it coulda been different

Now that it's done.

Baby, who's to say....

Baby, who's to say that it shoulda been

Anyway.

Baby, who's to say....

Baby, who's to say

That it even matters in the long run.

Who's to say.

Give it just a minute.

And it'll blow away.

It'll blow away.

Your case against me is so

Very clearly stated

I plead no contest,

I turn and shrug.

I've come to figure all importance

overestimated.

You must mean water when you beg for blood.

We Can Run But We Can't Hide

With Brent Mydland.  Recorded on Built To Last (Arista Records, 1989) .

Martinez, California   February 3, 1989

We don't own this place, though we act as if we did,

It's a loan from the children of our children's kids.

The actual owners haven't even been born yet.

But we never tend the garden and rarely we pay the rent,

Some of it is broken and the rest of it is bent

Put it all on plastic and I wonder where we'll be when the bills hit.

Chorus:

We can run,

But we can't hide from it.

Of all possible worlds,

We only got one:

We gotta to ride on it.

Whatever we've done,

We'll never get far from what we leave behind,

Baby, we can run, run, run, but we can't hide.

Oh no, we can't hide.

I'm dumpin' my trash in your back yard

Makin' certain you don't notice really isn't so hard

You're so busy with your guns and all of your excuses to use them.

Well, it's oil for the rich and babies for the poor,

We got everyone believin' that more is more,

If a reckoning comes, maybe we will know what to do then.

Bridge:

All these complications seem to leave no choice,

I heard the tongues of billions speak with just one voice,

Saying, "Just leave all the rest to me,

I need it worse than you, you see."

And then I heard...

The sound of one child crying.

Today I went walking in the amber wind,

There's a hole in the sky where the light pours in

I remembered the days when I wasn't afraid of the sunshine.

But now it beats down on the asphalt land

Like a hammering blow from God's left hand

What little still grows cringes in the shade like a bad vine.

==========================================

Picasso Moon

With Bob Weir and Bob Bralove.  Recorded on Built To Last (Arista Records,

1989) .

Mill Valley, California   February -May, 1989

First verse:

South of Market in the land of ruin

You get all manner of action

Tinsel tigers in The Metal Room

Stalking satisfaction.

They got 'em packaged up for love and money

Tattooed tots and chrome spike bunnies

Check my conscience at the DMZ

And roll on in, gonna roll in it, honey

But I get a feelin like when big things collide

Like the crack before the thunder, like I really ought to hide

And here comes Metal Angel, she looks ready to ride;

& What's that she's tryin' to show me..?

What's that you're tryin' to show me..?

Chorus:

Picasso Moon, shattered light

Diamond bullets ripping up the night

Picasso Moon, liberate me,

>From the middle of eternity,

Something hooks her little finger at me,

An' it's bigger than a drive-in movie, ooooo-eeee.

Bigger than a drive-in movie, ooooo-eeee.

Second verse:

Hangin' ten out on space and time

Redefining distance.

The next skull on your necklace is mine:

Cheap for such assistance

I had a job trading bits for pieces

We'd make wrinkles, advertise them as creases

Please, find my resignation enclosed,

Roll with it, roll with it, we gonna roll  in it, honey..,

Dark Angel, What's botherin' you?

So strange, you'll do me all that you do

Dark Angel, you're makin' me blue..,

I guess it doesn't matter..,

I guess it doesn't matter...

Second chorus:

Picasso Moon, blinding ball,

Spinning fire, the lightning calls

Picasso Moon, fall into the sky

Rarin' out, I'm gonna testify

And stare a shout into that burning eye,

Bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my.

Bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my.

Third verse:

Strikes morning; the atomic dawn,

Scramble back to cover.

Quick, pop your mirrored sunglasses on,

My little leather-winged lover.

I see your face printed on my money,

Your blazin' ways really move me, honey..!

Heart of darkness, Yea-e-yea-e-e-hoo..,

Why'm I laughing? This ain't funny

Dark Angel, now just don't start..,

You'll break my spirit, wreck my heart

You must  have a license for practisin' that art.

I don't presume to imagine.

I don't presume to imagine.

Chorus:

Picasso Moon, fractal flame

Blazing lace filling every frame

Picasso Moon, wheels within wheels

What's true when everything's real?

It's all new, I'm gonna scatter the seals

Bigger than a drive-in movie, for real.

Bigger than a drive-in movie, for real.

Picasso Moon, etc.

I Will Take You Home

With Brent Mydland.  Recorded on Built To Last (Arista Records, 1989) .

Martinez, California   February 23, 1988

Little girl lost

In a forest of dreams.

It's a dark old wood

And it's damp with dew.

Hoot owl hoots

For a moment it seems

Something big and cold

Got ahold of you.

Just when everything gets scary,

Daddy's come 'round for his darlin' again.

Hold my hand with your little fingers.

Daddy's loving arms gonna gather you in.

Ain't no way the Bogeyman can get you,

You can close your eyes, the world is gonna let you,

Your daddy's here and never will forget you,

I will take you home.

I will take you home.

Gonna carry you back home

In my arms.

I will take you home.

Long is the road

We must travel on down.

Short are the legs

That will struggle behind.

I wish I  knew for sure

Just where we're bound,

What we will be doin'

And what we're gonna find.

Wherever we go, there will be birds to cheer you

Flowers to color in the fields around.

Wherever we go, I'll be right here near you

You can't get lost when you're always found.

Ain't no fog that's thick enough to hide you

Your daddy's gonna be right here beside you

If your fears should start to get inside you.

I will take you home.

I will take you home.

Gonna carry you back home

In my arms.

I will take you home.

Gentlemen, Start Your Engines

With Brent Mydland.  Performed by Grateful Dead but not recorded.

Martinez, California   February 23, 1988

It's three AM in the combat zone.

Gentlemen start your engines!

They can close this bar, but baby I ain't going.

Gentlemen start your engines!

If you lock up the whiskey, give me gasoline.

I got a seven grand redline on the black machine.

The dead can do my sleepin', if you know what I mean.

Gentlemen start your engines!

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Gentlemen start

Gentlemen start

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Got a little girl here in a pinafore dress.

Gentlemen start your engines!

She's got more tricks than you can guess.

Gentlemen start your engines!

It's dark outside, but it's darker within.

Check the back of my jacket just to see my grin.

They don't write poems about the state that I'm in.

Gentlemen start your engines!

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Gentlemen start

Gentlemen start

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Bridge 1:

One of these days I've gonna pull myself together.

Soon as I finish tearin' myself apart

Like the Devil's Mustangs,

I've been ridden hell for leather,

Put away wet and angry in the dark.

When the police come you better let'em in,

Gentlemen start your engines!

Don't forget to tell'em what a sport I've been.

Gentlemen start your engines!

I got a head full of vintage TNT,

They're gonna blow me up'stead of burying me.

If you're lookin' for trouble, come here and sit with me.

Gentlemen start your engines!

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Gentlemen start

Gentlemen start

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Bridge 2 :

One of these days I've gonna pull myself together.

Soon as I finish tearin' myself apart

Let me tell you, honey,

There's some mighty stormy weather

Howlin' round the caverns of my heart.

Hell in a Bucket

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on In the Dark (Arista Records, 1987) .

Cora, Wyoming   August -December, 1982

Well, I was drinking last night with a biker

And I showed him a picture of you

I said, "Pal, get to know her.  You'll like her."

Seemed like the least I could do...

'Cause when he's driving his chopper

Up and down your carpeted halls,

You will think me by contrast quite proper.

Never mind how I stumble and fall.

Never mind how I stumble and fall.

Chorus:

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot

For a taste of your elegant pride

I may be going to Hell In A Bucket, babe,

But at least I'm enjoying the ride.

At least I'm enjoying the ride.

At least I'm enjoying the ride.

Now miss sweet little soft-core pretender,

Somehow baby got hard as it gets.

With her black leather chrome spiked suspenders,

Her chair and her whip and her pets.

Well we know you're the reincarnation

Of the ravenous Catherine the Great.

And we know how you love your ovations

For the Z-rated scenes you create.

The Z-rated scenes you create.

Bridge:

You analyze me, pretend to despise me,

You laugh when I stumble and fall.

There may come a day I will dance on your grave

If unable to dance, I will crawl across it

Unable to dance, I'll still crawl.

You must really consider the circus

'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo

I can't think of a place that's more perfect

For a person as perfect as you.

And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely

'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin

But I know that you'll think of me only

When the snakes come marching in

When the snakes come marching in

Throwing Stones

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on In the Dark (Arista Records, 1987) .

Cora, Wyoming   August -December, 1982

Picture a bright blue ball, just spinning, spinnin free,

Dizzy with eternity.

Paint it with a skin of sky,

Brush in some clouds and sea,

Call it home for you and me.

A peaceful place or so it looks from space,

A closer look reveals the human race.

Full of hope, full of grace

Is the human face,

But afraid we may lay our home to waste.

There's a fear down here we can't forget.

Hasn't got a name just yet.

Always awake, always around,

Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Now watch as the ball revolves

And the nighttime falls.

Again the hunt begins,

Again the bloodwind calls.

By and by, the morning sun will rise,

But the darkness never goes

>From some men's eyes.

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets,

Staking turf, dividing up meat.

Nightmare spook, piece of heat,

It's you and me.

You and me.

Click flash blade in Ghetto night,

Rudies  looking for a fight.

Rat cat alley, roll them bones.

Need that cash to feed that jones.

And the politicians throwin' stones,

Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Bridge:

Commissars and pin-stripe bosses

Roll the dice.

Any way they fall,

Guess who gets to pay the price.

Money green or proletarian gray,

Selling guns 'stead of food today.

So the kids they dance

And shake their bones,

And the politicians throwin' stones,

Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Heartless powers try to tell us

What to think.

If the spirit's sleeping,

Then the flesh is ink.

History's page will thus be carved in stone.

And we are here, and we are on our own.

On our own.

On our own.

On our own.

(Instrumental)

If the game is lost,

Then we're all the same.

No one left to place or take the blame.

We can leave this place and empty stone

Or that shinin' ball we used to call our home.

So the kids they dance

And shake their bones,

And the politicians throwin' stones,

Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Bridge two:

Shipping powders back and forth,

Singing black goes south and white comes north.

In a whole world full of petty wars,

Singing I got mine and you got yours.

And the current fashion sets the pace,

Lose your step, fall out of grace.

And the radical, he rant and rage,

Singing someone's got to turn the page.

And the rich man in his summer home,

Singing just leave well enough alone.

But his pants are down, his cover's blown...

And the politicians throwin' stones,

So the kids they dance

And shake their bones,

And it's all too clear we're on our own.

Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Picture a bright blue ball,

Just spinnin', spinnin, free.

Dizzy with the possibilities.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

My Brother Esau

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on In the Dark (Arista Records, 1987) .

Cora, Wyoming   August -December, 1982

My brother Esau killed a hunter

Back in 1969.

And before the killing was done,

His inheritance was mine.

But his birthright was a wand to wave

Before a weary band.

Esau gave me sleeplessness

And a piece of moral land.

My father favored Esau,

Who was eager to obey

All the bloody wild commandments

The Old Man shot his way.

But all this favor ended

When my brother failed at war.

He staggered home

And found me in the door.

Chorus:

Esau skates on mirrors anymore...

He meets his pale reflection at the door.

Yet sometimes at night I dream

He's still that hairy man,

Shadowboxing the Apocalypse

And wandering the land.

Shadowboxing the Apocalypse

And wandering the land.

Esau holds a blessing;

Brother Esau bears a curse.

I would say that the blame is mine

But I suspect it's something worse.

The more my brother looks like me,

The less I understand

The silent war that bloodied both our hands.

Sometimes at night, I think I understand.

It's brother to brother and it's man to man

And it's face to face and it's hand to hand...

We shadowdance the silent war within.

The shadowdance, it never ends...

Never ends, never ends.

Shadowboxing the Apocalypse, yet again...

Yet again.

Shadowboxing the Apocalypse,

And wandering the land.

Mill Valley, California   January, 1980

Inside you're burnin'.

I can see clear through.

Your eyes tell more than you mean them to:

Lit up and flashing, like the reds and blues

Out there on the neon avenue.

Still I feel like a stranger.

Feel like a stranger.

Well, the music's thundering,

Restless and hot.

You shoot glances across the room,

And I can't stop wondering,

Just what you got.

Get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon.

Still I feel like a stranger

Feel like a stranger

Well you know, it's gonna get stranger,

So let's get on with the show.

Let's go.

Yes and the wheels get smokin' 'round midnight.

You showed me a look that says, "Let's go."

Yes and it feels 'bout like runnin' a red light.

Ain't no point in lookin' behind us, no.

Still, I feel like a stranger, feel like a stranger.

You know it's gonna get stranger.

If it's love then how would I know?

Let's get on with the show.

Feel like a stranger.

Feel like a stranger.

Feel like a stranger.

Gonna be a long long crazy crazy night.

Gonna be a long long crazy crazy night.

Silky silky crazy crazy night.

It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night.

Silky silky crazy crazy night.

Lost Sailor

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Go to Heaven (Arista Records, 1980) .

Mill Valley, California   July, 1979

The compass card is spinnin'.

The helm is swingin' to and fro.

Ooh, where's the Dog Star?

Ooh, where's the moon?

You're a lost sailor.  You've been too long at sea.

Now the shore lights beckon.  Yeah, there's a price for bein' free.

Some days the gales are howlin'.  Some days the sea is still as glass.

Ooh, reef the mainsail.

Ooh, lash the mast.

You're a lost sailor.  You've been too long at sea.

Now the shore lights beckon.  Yeah, there's a price for bein' free.

Yeah, the sea bird's cryin',

And there's a ghost wind blowin'.

It's callin' you to that misty swirlin' sea.

Till the chains of your dreams are broken,

No place in the world you can be.

You're a lost sailor.  You've been too long at sea.

Now the shore lights beckon.  Yeah, there's a price for bein' free.

Driftin'.  Yeah, driftin'.  Yeah, driftin' and dreamin'.

There's a place you've never been.

Maybe a face you've never seen.

You can hear 'em callin' on the wind.

Go on and drift your life away, driftin' and dreamin'.

Drift your life away, maybe goin' on a dream.

Maybe goin' for a feelin', goin' for a feelin' --

Drift your life away.

Saint of Circumstance

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Go to Heaven (Arista Records, 1980) .

Mill Valley, California   July, 1979

This must be heaven --

Tonight I crossed the line.

You must be the angel

I thought I'd never find.

Was it you I heard singin'

While I was chasin' dreams?

Driven by the wind,

Like the dust that blows around

And the rain fallin' down...

Well I never know,

Sure don't know,

Never know,

Never know,

Sure don't know.

This must be heaven --

This is where the rainbow ends.

At last it's the real thing...

At least I can pretend.

When that wind blows,

And the darkness starts to fall,

I can hear the sirens call.

It's a certain sort of sound

In the rain fallin' down,

Rain fallin down...

Rain fallin down...

Rain fallin down...

Rain fallin down...

Bridge:

Holes in what's left of my reason,

Holes in the knees of my blues,

Odds against me been increasin'

But I'll pull through.

Never could read no road map

And I don't know what the weather might do,

But hear that witch wind whinin'

See that Dog Star's shinin',

I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose,

No time to lose!

Maybe goin' on a feelin'  maybe goin' on a dream

Maybe goin' on a feelin'

Well I never know,

Sure don't know,

Never know,

Never know,

Sure don't know.

Well it's been heaven

But even rainbows end.

Now my sails are fillin'

And the wind's so willin'

That I'm good as gone again.

I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance

Just a saint of circumstance,

Like a tiger in a trance,

In the rain fallin down

Rain fallin down...

Rain fallin down...

Rain fallin down...

Rain fallin down...

Well I never know  just don't know  just don't know

Well, I sure don't know

What I'm goin' for

But I'm gonna go for it,

That's for sure.

Maybe goin' on a feelin'

Maybe goin' on a dream

Maybe goin' on a feelin'

Easy To Love You

With Brent Mydland.  Recorded on Go to Heaven (Arista Records, 1980) .

Mill Valley, California   January, 1980

Good, good morning.  So good to see you

Weren't just a dream of mine.

Real as a raven.

Real as thunder.

Real as the sun shining.

But still so very undefined

Can't imagine what's behind

Those sleepy eyes.

Ooooo..

Little stranger, don't try to hide now.

You look so young when you're afraid.

There is no danger but from the devil.

He may want you, but I'm in his way.

You don't know how easy it is.

You don't know how easy it is to love you.

Ooooo..

And comes the moonrise, when the dew falls.

Don't be the sun that fades away.

Don't leave me darkness.  She is no lover.

She hides the day.

You don't know how easy it is.

You don't know how easy it is to love you.

You don't know how easy it is.

You don't know how easy it is to love you.

Ooooo..

I Need A Miracle

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Shakedown Street (Arista Records, 1978) .

Mill Valley, California   July, 1978

I need a woman 'bout twice my age,

A lady of nobility, gentility and rage --

A splendor in the dark -- lightnin' on the draw.

We'll go right through the book, and break each and every law.

I got a feeling, and it won't go away.  oh, no.

Just one thing, then I'll be okay.

I need a miracle every day.

I need a woman 'bout twice my height --

Statuesque, raven-tressed, a goddess of the night

With a secret incantations, candles burning blue.

We consult the spirits.

Maybe they'll know what to do.

And it's real, and it won't go away.  Oh, no.

Can't get around it, and I can't run away.

I need a miracle every day.

I need a woman 'bout twice my weight --

A ton of fun, who packs a gun with all that other freight.

Find her in a sideshow.  Leave her in L.A.

Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave.

And it's real.  Believe what I say, oh yeah.

Just one thing that I got to say:

I need a miracle every day.

It takes dynamite to get me up.

Too much of everything is just enough.

One more thing:  I just got to say,

I need a miracle every day!

Heaven Help The Fool

With Bob Weir  Recorded on Heaven Help The Fool (Arista Records, 1977)

Los Angeles, California   July, 1977

I was born in Flatland, U.S.A.

And all my dreams led me to L.A.

Another case of rags to riches:

I learned to throw some fancy pitches,

And I found out what ain't, and which is,

Just exactly cool.

Heaven help the fool --

Guess I showed the sons of bitches.

Heaven help the fool --

Got a place in Malibu --

Like you've never seen.

Pickin' out your lady friends --

>From Penthouse magazine.

You ought to see the chrome gleam

On my Mercedes, all shiny and new.

Hey, I'm the jack of diamonds,

The boy with all the clues.

Lotta pretty vanity -- No, not me.

Glorified insanity -- No, not me.

Fool!

I'm a hyper-survivor, fast driver,  stardriver,

Heaven help the fool --

Professional gimme-fiver.

Heaven help the fool --

Anything that you want to be

You can buy, even get it free.

Make yourself a smoother dancer.

Fill your head with easy answers.

Never a backward glancer,

It's you who make the rules.

Heaven help the fool --

Never a backward glancer.

Heaven help the fool --

Heaven help the fool --

Heart of a star

That's what you are --

You can trade your soul for an electric guitar.

Fool!

Lotta pretty vanity--

No, not me.

Fool!

Glorified insanity--

No, not me.

When they offer golden apples,

Are you sure you'll refuse?

Heaven help the fool --

Just like a deaf man dancin',

Like a blind man shootin' pool.

Heaven help the fool --

Estimated Prophet

With Bob Weir  Recorded on Terrapin Station (Arista Records, 1977)

Cora, Wyoming -Mill Valley, California   January, 1977

My time comin' any day -- don't worry 'bout me, no.

Been so long I felt this way -- I'm in no hurry, no.

Rainbow's end down that highway,

Where ocean breezes blow.

My time comin', the voices say.

They tell me where to go.

Don't worry 'bout me;

No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no.

And I'm in no hurry, no, no, no.

I know where to go.

California!  Preaching  on the burning shore.

California!  I'll be knocking on the golden door.

Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light

Rising up to paradise,

I know I'm gonna shine.

My time comin' any day -- don't worry 'bout me, no.  ...

It's goin' to be just like they say.  Them voices tell me so.

Seems so long I felt this way, and time sure passes slow.

Still I know I'll lead the way.  They tell me where to go.

California!  A prophet on the burning shore.

California!  I'll be knocking on the golden door.

Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light

Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine.

You've all been asleep.

You would not believe me,

Fire wheel burnin' in the air.

Them voices telling me:

You will soon receive me.

Way up, in the middle of the air.

Standing on the beach -- the sea will part before me,

Fire wheel burnin' in the air.

You will follow me, and we will ride to glory,

Way up, in the middle of the air.

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same.

As my words fill the sky with flame.

Might and Glory's gonna be my name.

They gonna light my way.

My time comin' any day -- don't worry 'bout me, no.

It's gonna be just like they say--them voices tell me so.

Afternoon, the streets turn grey  and I watch the crowds below

My time comin', voices saying.  They tell me where to go.

Don't worry 'bout me; no, no, don't worry 'bout me, no.

And I'm in no hurry, no, no, no.  I know where to go.

My time comin' any day.  Don't worry 'bout me, no.

It's gonna be just like they say.  Them voices tell me so.

Seems so long I felt this way, and time sure passin' slow.

My time comin' any day.  Don't worry 'bout me, no.

Don't worry 'bout me; no, no, don't worry 'bout me, no.

And I'm in no hurry, no, no, no.  I know where to go.

And I'm in no hurry, no, no, no.  Don't worry 'bout me, no. ...

Lazy Lightnin'

With Bob Weir  Recorded on Kingfish (Round Records, 1975)

Mill Valley, California   October, 1975

Lazy lightning.

Sleepy fire in your eyes.

Is it desire in disguise?

I keep on tryin' but I--

I can't get through

Lazy lightning.

I'd like to find the proper potion

To kinda capture your emotion.

You're right beside me but I--

I can't get through.

You're a loop of lazy lightning,

Liquid loop of lazy lightning,

Must admit you're kinda fright'ning,

But you really get me high.

So exciting,

When I hear your velvet thunder.

Seems so near I start to wonder,

Would you come closer if I--

I asked you to?

So inviting,

The way you're messin' with my reason.

It's an obsession but it's pleasin'

Tell me a lie and I will swear

I'll swear it's true.

You're a loop of lazy lightning,

Liquid loop of lazy lightning,

Must admit you're kinda fright'ning,

Liquid loop of lazy lightning.

Rope of fire 'round my heart,

Rope of fire ever tight'nin',

Rope of fire 'round my heart,

It's either lunacy or lightnin'.

Lazy lightning

The way you always 'lectrify me

Someday I know you'll satisfy me

And all that lightning will be my lightning too

My lightning too.

The Music Never Stopped

With Bob Weir  Recorded on Blues for Allah (Grateful Dead Records, 1975)

Cora, Wyoming -Mill Valley, California   June, 1975

There's mosquitoes on the river.

Fish are rising up like birds.

It's been hot for seven weeks now,

Too hot to even speak now.

Did you hear what I just heard?

Say, it might have been a fiddle,

Or it could have been the wind.

But there seems to be a beat, now.

I can feel it in my feet, now.

Listen, here it comes again!

There's a band out on the highway.

They're high-steppin' into town.

They're a rainbow full of sound.

It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns --

Everybody's dancing.

Come on, children.  Come on, children,

Come on clap your hands.

Sun went down in honey.

Moon came up in wine.

Stars were spinnin' dizzy,

Lord, the band kept us so busy

We forgot about the time.

They're a band beyond description

Like Jehovah's favorite choir.

People joinin' hand in hand

While the music plays the band.

Lord, they're setting us on fire.

Crazy rooster crowin' midnight.

Balls of lightning roll along.

Old men sing about their dreams.

Women laugh and children scream,

And the band keeps playin' on.

Keep on dancin' through to daylight.

Greet the morning air with song.

No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone.

Was it ever here at all?

But they keep on dancing.

C'mon, children.  C'mon, children,

Come on clap your hands.

Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday,

And the corn's a bumper crop.

The fields are full of dancing,

Full of singing and romancing,

'Cause the music never stopped.

Finance Blues

With Bob Weir  Recorded on Mars Hotel (Grateful Dead Records, 1974)

Cora, Wyoming -Mill Valley, California   February, 1974

My baby gives me them finance blues.

She tax me to the limit of my revenues.

Here she comes finger-poppin', clickety-click.

She says furs or diamonds, you can take your pick.

Chorus:

She wants money.  ( -- what she wants, )

She wants money.  ( -- what she wants, )

She wants money.  ( -- what she wants, )

She wants money.  ( -- what she wants, )

Money  money  money  money  money

Money  money  money  money  money.

She says "Money, honey" .  I'd rob a bank.

I just load my gun and mosey down to the bank.

Knockin' off my neighborhood savings & loan,

Keep my sweet Chiquita in eau de cologne.

Mama don't send me down to rob that bank again.

I got a notion you're leadin' me to sin.

Won't you relax?  Won't you lay back?

Don't you bug your honey 'bout no Cadillac.

It's only bucks.  You don't need no jack.

So won't you please relax, and lay 'way back.

My baby's lovin' gives me such a thrill,

Give me inspiration makin' counterfeit bills.

Now some folks say the best things in life are free.

I sure don't get no lovin' livin' honestly.

The Lord made a lady out of Adam's rib.

Next thing you know you got wimmen's lib.

Lovely to look upon, heaven to touch.

It's a real shame they got to cost so much.

Let It Grow (Weather Report II)

With Bob Weir. Recorded on Wake of the Flood (Grateful Dead Records, 1973)

Salt Lake City, Utah  February, 1973

Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore.

Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door .

See the sun sparkle in the reeds,

Silver beads, passing to the sea

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter,

She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water,

And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.

Let it flow,

Greatly flow,

Bright  and  clear.

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field.

Seasons 'round, the bushels of corn in the barley meal,

Broken ground, open and beckoning  to the spring;

Black dirt live again!

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing ,

And he dances the circular track of the plow, ever knowing

That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing .

Let it grow,

Let it grow,

Greatly yield!

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?

As well to count the angels dancing on a pin

Water bright as the sky from which it came,

And the name is on the earth that takes it in.

We will not speak but stand inside the rain

And listen to the thunder shout:

I am.

I am.

I am.

I AM.

So it goes, we make what we've made since the world began:

Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men

Seasons 'round, creatures great and small, up and down,

As we rise and fall.

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?

As well to count the angels dancing on a pin

Water bright as the sky from which it came,

And the name is on the earth that takes it in.

We will not speak but stand inside the rain

And listen to the thunder shout:

I am.

I am.

I am.

I AM.

Black-Throated Wind

With Bob Weir. Recorded on Ace (Warner Brothers, 1972)

Cora, Wyoming -San Anselmo, California  February, 1972

Bringing me down,

I'm running aground

Blind in the light of the interstate cars.

Passing me by,

The busses and semis,

Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars.

But I'm here by the road,

Bound to the load

That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.

Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up,

The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars.

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in

With its words of a life where nothing is new.

Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light.

Ohhh, I'm drowning in you.

I left St. Louis, the City of Blues,

In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget.

I tried to pretend  it came to an end

Cause you weren't the woman I thought I once met.

But I can't deny that times have gone by

When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret

And I was a man when all this began

Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet.

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in.

And it speaks of a life that passes like dew.

It's forced me to see that you've done better by me,

Better by me than I've done by you.

What's to be found, racing around,

You carry your pain wherever you go.

Full of the blues and trying to lose

You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know.

So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies

Please help them to learn as well as to see

Capture a glance and make it a dance

Of looking at you looking at me.

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in

With its words of a lie that could almost be true.

Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light.

I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do

Goin back home that's what I'm gonna do

Turnin' around,

That's what I'm gonna do

'Cause you've done better by me

Than I've done by you. . .

==========================================

Walk in the Sunshine

With Bob Weir. Recorded on Ace (Warner Brothers, 1972)

Forest Knolls, California  February, 1972

''Look  out, folks,' cause here comes some free advice..."

Walk in the sunshine,

Watch for the bright sign.

Be all those things you're able to be.

You got to listen to the heavens,

You got to try and understand,

The greatness of their movement

Is just as small as it is grand.

Try not to hurry,

It's just your worry.

Leave it to those all caught up in time.

You got to deep-six your wristwatch

You got to try and understand

The time it seems to capture

Is just the movement of its hands.

I ain't preaching, cause I don't know

How to make fast things move along slow

I can't stop it.  I can't make it go.

Just cause I say it, that don't mean it's so.

Watch what you hear now

Make sure it's clear now

Just cause it's said that don't mean that it's true

'Cause people say:

"You got to make a revolution

You got to help me with my cause

You got to burn down all the buildings

You got to rub out all the laws."

But I ain't burning

Lord, I'm only learning

How to become a man of my own.

I ain't crazy

Nor am I lazy

Just want to find out what's right and what's wrong

I ain't crazy, the world keeps on turnin'

Just want to find out what's right and what's wrong

I ain't crazy.

Looks Like Rain

With Bob Weir. Recorded on Ace (Warner Brothers, 1972).

Cora, Wyoming  January, 1972

I woke today...

And felt your side of bed

The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'.

You were gone...

My heart was filled with dread.

You might not be sleepin' here again

Chorus:

It's alright, 'cause I love you.

And that's not gonna change.

Run me round, make me hurt again and again.

But I'll still sing you love songs

Written in the letters of your name.

And brave the storm to come,

For it surely looks like rain.

Did you ever waken to the sound

Of street cats makin' love

And guess from their cries

You were listenin' to a fight?

Well, you know...

Hate's just the last thing they're thinkin' of.

They're only trying to make it through the night.

Chorus:

I only want to hold you.

I don't want to tie you down.

Or fence you in the lines

I might have drawn.

It's just that I've gotten used to

Havin' you around.

My landscape would be empty

If you were gone.

Cassidy

With Bob Weir. Recorded on Ace (Warner Brothers, 1972)

Cora, Wyoming  February, 1972

I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream.

I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream.

Ah, child of countless trees.

Ah, child of boundless seas.

What you are, what you're meant to be

Speaks his name, though you were born to me,

Born to me,

Cassidy...

Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac.

I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back.

Come wash the nighttime clean,

Come grow this scorched ground green,

Blow the horn, tap the tambourine

Close the gap of the dark years in between

You and me,

Cassidy...

Quick beats in an icy heart.

Catch-colt draws a coffin cart.

There he goes now, here she starts:

Hear her cry.

Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words

Wheel to the storm and fly.

Faring thee well now.

Let your life proceed by its own design.

Nothing to tell now.

Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine.

(Repeat)

Mexicali Blues

With Bob Weir. Recorded on Ace (Warner Brothers, 1972).

Middletown, Connecticut  February 1971

Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand,

Just watchin' flies and children on the street.

I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile.

There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet.

And It's three days ride from Bakersfield,

And I don't know why I came.

I guess I came to keep from payin' dues.

So, instead, I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen,

And a damned good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose

If the Devil wants to take it all away?

Cherish well your thoughts and keep a tight grip on your booze

Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.

She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town.

I didn't know a stage-line ran from Hell.

She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold,

And all the french perfume you'd care to smell.

She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear,

Go on, my friend, do anything you choose..."

Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms

With a life-time's worth of Mexicali Blues.

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose

When he lets a woman hold him in her hand?

You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark

Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands.

Then a man rode into town some thought he was the law.

But Billy Jean was waitin' when he came.

She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun

And I'd have no one but myself to blame.

I went down to those dusty streets--blood was on my mind.

I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news.

Cause I shot first and killed him. Lord, he didn't even draw.

And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues.

Falling

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Where the Beat Meets the Street  (Arista

Records, 1984).

Los Angeles, California  December, 1983

Twilight.

The sun is setting again.

Street lights

Are blinking on in the rain.

Waiting

Where I have waited before

Knowing that you

Will never come to catch me, 'cause

I'm falling,

Catch me. I'm falling

For your heartbreak,

Calling,

Never an answer 'cause

I'm falling alone.

Blue moon.

And I'm so blue that it shows.

It's your tune

And now I know just how it goes.

Somewhere

The night is hot with your love.

Melt into him

And feel me tumbling freely 'cause

I'm falling,

Catch me. I'm falling

For your heartbreak,

Calling,

Never an answer 'cause

I'm falling alone.

Gloria Monday

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Where the Beat Meets the Street  (Arista

Records, 1984).

Los Angeles, California  December, 1983

Gloria Monday came to my house

Last Tuesday afternoon

She is wearing my resistance to the bone.

She wrote me a letter, sent me a card

And a singing telegram,

Why, she called so much I had to disconnect the phone.

When she's in town, I'll never be alone.

Chorus:

Gloria Monday, Gloria Monday

She whispers in my ear

In a voice so sweet and clear,

"You are the greatest."

Yeh, yeh and Gloria Monday

Has gotten my name on every major list

Of the hottest and the coolest and the latest.

Gloria Monday sits down front

In the auditorium

Where she hands on every number that I play.

She dances and wiggles, bounces and giggles

And leaves me with no doubt

That with half and ounce of effort, I'd get laid.

Gloria Monday has lately been seen

With a writer from L.A.

Who has written a book

About all of the new positions.

And it isn't just him, there's a fella named Jim

Who's an actor on TV:

There's a photographer and a couple of hip physicians.

Yes, I believe she's a lady with a mission.

Fly Away

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Bobby and the Midnights (Arista Records, 1981)

Cora, Wyoming  July, 1981

Fly away, I want to fly away

Right now, right here, tonight.

High away, way up high away

Hey, we all got a right.

Fallen Angels of earth have forgotten the sky.

We're afraid of our dreams, we're afraid or too blind.

But blindness holds better than chains,

And chains are always too tight.

Fly away, yeah, ride the sky away,

Kingdom come tonight.

Mighty day, yeah the stone rolls away,

Chains will melt in the light.

They will tell you your wings have lost the power of flight,

Flew too close to the sun, fell back into the night.

But if we open our eyes, we can open our wings

Hey, and sail out of sight.

Higher and higher, goin' straight for the light.

Feel the fire, or you'll feel the fright.

Hey tonight, fly away tonight.

Fly away tonight.

Fly away, yeah, fly away

Right now, right here, tonight.

Light of day, I want to see light of day

Way up over this night.

Well, this old ball of blue will go on spinning around.

If you're staying behind, take good care of the ground.

Just let go of my wings, don't lock up our dreams,

Don't deny us the sky, hey, we'll see you around.

Master of fire,

Roll 'em up high, roll 'em up high

To master the fire, remember that you can fly.

Me, Without You

With Alphonso Johnson.  Recorded on Bobby and the Midnights (Arista

Records, 1981).

Mill Valley, California   July, 1981

Me, just a face I see,

A motel mirror lookin' back at me,

It comes and goes with the flash of a neon light.

You, another fantasy,

Another replica of ecstasy,

A broken promise I will break again tonight, just

Me, without you, without me, me without

We are just a state of mind, feeding needs that are always blind,

Sightless armies in the battleground of night, the

Sheets become an angry sea, tossed by bodies that just gotta be

Something more for trying to unite, more than

Me, without you without me

Me, without you without me

Me, without you without me

Me, without you and me

The light of morning will dissolve us away

Nothing said, 'cause there's nothing to say

Sending post cards from places we've never been, deep within.

Other voices heard in some other room,

Another planet lit by some other moon,

We'll meet strangers and be, together again and again, yeah,

Me, without you without me

Me, without you without me

Me, without you without me

Yeah, that's the way it must be, the way it must be

It's the song we're playin'

Gonna take a lot of love, gonna take a lot of love

But maybe some day...

Bombs Away

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Heaven Help The Fool (Arista Records, 1977)

Los Angeles, California - Salt Lake City, Utah   July, 1977

Bombs away.

Well, I guess I'm back in love again.

And around we go.

This will bring me ruin, but I s'pose it's pleasin'.

I've changed the eyes I gaze in,

But she's just another girl.

I need more than a trade-in.

Guess I'll have to change the world.

Strike up the band.

I believe I have this dance.

Hey, raise that glass again, my friend.

Yes, I know I'm charming. But she's so easy.

I've changed the tune I dance to

In this gay ol' social whirl.

But if I get a chance to,

I just might change the world.

It's just the same old movie.

Been playin' here for years.

I could use a change of scenery.

But when I get there I'm still here...

Coming soon:  Another day in paradise,

At a theater near you

And  they'll be showing it forever.

So let them keep parading.

Give them all batons to twirl.

For me the splendor's fading.

Yeah, I'll have to change the world.

Yes, it's still the same ol' movie.

And I've seen it all before.

Guess one more run-through won't undo me.

Hell, I'll just watch the show some more.

Hey some more, yeah, some more.

Sit back and watch it some more.

Guess I'll just watch the show some more.

Hey some more, yeah, some more.

But I'd like to know what for.

Hey, don't you worry 'bout what for.

Bombs away,

Well I guess I'm back in love again.

Hey round and round we go, etc.

Salt Lake City

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Heaven Help The Fool (Arista Records, 1977)

Los Angeles, California - Salt Lake City, Utah   July, 1977

It was a paradise for lizards when young Brigham saw it first

He said, "I've seen some nasty deserts, Lord, but this one here's the worst."

Then the Lord called down to Brigham, said, "I got a great idea --

I want a mighty city and I think I want it here."

Salt Lake City,  that town of righteousness and fame

Salt Lake City,  don't sound like much but hell, what's in a name?

Nobody ever sings about it,

But Lord I be goin' there just the same.

Salt Lake City, where it's so easy keepin' straight.

Salt Lake City, really makes Des Moines look second-rate.

Ain't makin' no big deal about it,

But I hear the Mormon girls are really great.

Salt Lake City,  hey, dig that tabernacle choir.

Salt Lake City,  yeah, they're bound to take you higher.

There ain't no two ways about it...

Yes Lord, they really light my fire.

Well, Brigham kicked a prairie dog and muttered in his beard

He said, "You've put me through some changes, Lord,

                            but this one's really weird."

The Lord just laughed at Brigham, said, "You'd better get to work --

The next time I check in here, I want Paradise on Earth."

Salt Lake City,  where Brigham made the desert bloom,

Salt Lake City,  put a color TV in every room,

And they got them crazy little Mormon chicks

Yes I'll be goin' there really soon.

Salt Lake City,  hey feel that magic in the air ...

==========================================

Shade of Gray

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Heaven Help The Fool (Arista Records, 1977)

Salt Lake City, Utah   July, 1977

Guess it's just a shade of grey...

When my head clears I might realize,  just might realize

But those grey eyes gonna stay with me awhile

Chorus:

But out in the streets

Well it's night time on Broadway.

Out in the streets,

They just don't even know.

But seven stories high

All their dreams have been realized,  are being realized

And those grey eyes just light up and shine

When I touch her face with mine.

Out on the streets,

It's a whole other number.

Out on the streets,

It's on with the show.

Too well I know that crowd of strangers.

I've played my part in that lovely show.

Out in the streets,

Hear them racing their engines.

Out in the streets,

They got nowhere to go.

I know it's just a shade of grey

And these peaceful moments never last,

They're gone so fast,

But those grey eyes beckon me once more

And we're ridin' out the storm.

Out in the streets,

They're all waitin' for mornin'

Out in the streets,

It just may never show.

Out in the streets,

Night flows like a river.

Out in the streets,

Time sits like a stone

Out in the streets,

They've all got each another.

Out in the streets,

How come they're always alone?

It's too late to find a lover,

It's too early to go home...

But up here in the sky, all their dreams are being realized...

==========================================

This Time Forever

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Heaven Help The Fool (Arista Records, 1977)

Cora, Wyoming   July, 1977

We'd had plenty of lovers.  We had put in our time.

We were anything but blind.

As certain as angels

Of perpetual flight,

When we met, we saw the light.

Chorus:

This one for sure.

This time forever.

But it turned to sand,

Slipping through our hands...

As time slipped away.

She was a stranger when I woke and saw her face.

She moved in for the winter.

Made a garden in May.

Summer came, then the cold autumn grey.

I was gone when she left me.

There was nothing to leave --

Swept away on a breeze.

This one for sure.

This time forever.

But it turned to sand,

Slipping through our hands...

As time slipped away.

She was a stranger when I woke and saw her face.

Wrong Way Feelin'

With Bob Weir.  Recorded on Heaven Help The Fool (Arista Records, 1977)

Los Angeles, California   July, 1977

Girl, you make me suspect there are certain delights

That might be news to me,

And I know at a glance you could show me all the sights

I'd ever care to see.

You're a queen of the elite, and a treat between the sheets,

But I wonder if it's all for free...

It's that wrong-way feelin'.

Oooooo, hooo.

Wrong-way feelin'.

Oooooo, hooo.

Go back says the sign way back in my mind...

But I can't get away from you.

Honey, you're comin' on just like Pharaoh's daughter --

All silk and style and class.

And down I go, like a lamb to the slaughter.

Honey, here's my ass.

I already seen this show, you know I'm gonna go.

But ain't we takin' this a bit too fast?

It's that wrong-way feelin'.

Oooooo, hooo.

Wrong-way feelin'.

Oooooo, hooo.

Go back says the sign way back in my mind...

But I can't get away from you.

We all know the story about Helen of Troy,

And her thousand ships:

Well, she didn't have a thing that could get to this boy,

Like a shake of your hips.

What you're doing to me now I know my mama don't allow,

And there's trouble painted on your lips.

It's that wrong-way feelin'.

Oooooo, hooo.

Wrong-way feelin'.

Oooooo, hooo.

Go back says the sign way back in my mind...

But I can't get away from you.

Ooooo,  sweet siren....

Come on 'n' hit my switch!

Ooooo,  sweet siren....

I never could resist a bitch!





Stopping the Information Railroad
=================================

Keynote Address Winter 1994 USENIX Conference

San Francisco, California January 17, 1994

by John Perry Barlow

Over the last four or five years since I left the cattle business I've started to feel like my life has turned into a Thomas Pynchon novel. Weird experiences are so numerous that I don't even keep track of them anymore. But I've got to say, for somebody who's spent most of his working career pushing cows around, this is a very weird audience for me today.

You people are great though. I honestly believe, and I say this without hyperbole, that the people in this room are doing things which will change the world more, in terms of what it is to be a human being, than anything since the capture of fire. I'll try to justify that very broad statement as I go along here.

I'm not entirely unqualified to think and talk about wild places. I'm from a part of Wyoming. The county I live in is larger than the Netherlands and has a population of 3500 at the moment. It is the focal point of the history of the fur trade. The fur trade was an economic manifestation that came into the west in the 1820's and 30's. Many of its constituents would be familiar to you.

They were kind of a fractious lot of misfits and opinionated loners. They were somewhat irregular in both their eating habits and their personal hygiene. They were hairy and anarchistic. They were smart. They created a society which was largely self organizing. And they were exploring unmapped territory using tools they developed themselves for getting around. I would try to draw a close parallel between them and the people in this room but I think that will be unnecessary.

When I first started to put my head into Cyberspace, it was not as unfamiliar to me as it is to a lot of folks who are now getting into that area, because it had a lot of the characteristics that still remained culturally in my odd little part of the world. I could see that a number of things were going to go on in there. One of which, if history was to be any guide, was that after a very free society had developed naturally in a very free place, then another society would come and try to make money off of it, and in the course of trying to make money off of it, would impose an awful lot of control.

There has been a lot of unfortunate talk about the National Information Infrastructure being a data superhighway. This is largely an artifact of the fact that Al Gore's father was instrumental in creating the Interstate System. So it's no mistake that Al Gore likes that metaphor. But in fact, what has been going on lately reminds me a lot more of the development of the railroad in this country. It is not a data superhighway so much as a data railroad system that we seem to be developing.

There is a cautionary tale in there because the folks like Jay Gould and his fellow barbarians who created the railway system in the west knew that if they owned the roadbed, and the area around it, they also essentially owned the society that was going to develop there. They could tariff whatever products were going to be created in that society on the basis of their own whim. The west today is still trying to get out from underneath the burden of regulation and legal standardization that was created in those early days by the railroad guys.

It was almost impossible for farmers in the upper midwest to make a living for a while even though the Northern Pacific Railroad had asked them to come in there and settle for nothing and had given them land. As soon as they got established on that land they were charged usurious rates for transporting their product to market. If we look at the history of the railroad we can see exactly what kind of damage occurs when we give too few people control over too much of the economy.

Actually I think it's far more useful to look at the development of the Internet in biological rather than structural terms. The Internet seems to me very much like a life form. It has all those characteristics. It is self organizing. It adapts itself readily into the possibilities faced that it finds. It is being created in an interactive way out at the margins rather than in the center.

I've heard UNIX described as a virus from outer space, and it is very much like a virus, I think, but it's more of a virus from inner space. The space inside the cerebral cavities of many of the people in this room.

Among the notable characteristics of the Internet, outside of explosive growth, is the extent to which it can naturally route itself around problems. John Gilmore, who may be here and is known to many of you, said something profound: "The Internet deals with censorship as a malfunction."It really does. You see people trying to stop traffic in certain kinds of intellectual material on the Internet. It simply routes itself around it and gets that material distributed by some other pathway.

Unfortunately, the folks who are now entering the game ... to a more precise extent, the organizations and institutions ... that are now entering the game, are very different from what has previously has characterized the development of digital networks in the world. They come at this with a different paradigm of how the world works and how to create order. They come at it with the notion that order is something that you impose and not something that emerges. They come at it thinking about their products as something focused and centralized, that require large amounts of capital to create, that are broadcast in a one-to-many medium.

I don't think these are necessarily bad people. But they have a very hard time understanding the modern digital environment. Most of the folks that I've talked to from the television industry think that interactive television consists of putting a "buy" button on your channel clicker. I'm not kidding! I wish I were. They fail to understand that there is a profound difference between information and experience. They are trying to sell non-interactive stored information as though it were experience. And I think that they actually believe that they are accomplishing that task. They are going to try, in many ways ... some of them overt, some of them unknown even to themselves ... to impose their culture and their metaphors on this environment.

There are all sorts of ways in which their immune response system is already working and I'll give you just one example. I was recently talking to somebody from Viacom about the importance of creating interoperability between whatever set top boxes Viacom was sponsoring, and other kinds of networking ... specifically the Internet. I talked about TCP/IP with this fellow from Viacom. He said, "Well we would love be able to incorporate TCP/IP, but really, it's just too slow, the packets are just too big, they can't be made to be isochronous. We really don't think that it has a place on top of your television set."

While that may seem like an irrelevant factor to many of you who probably don't even own a television set, if we are to create a society on the Internet that is genuinely inclusive, and doesn't consist of its present large band of wild geese, we are going to have to make it so that you can get Internet connection from that electronic device that is your principle access point into Cyberspace. That may well to be the set top box.

The folks in the television and entertainment business are also intrigued by the possibilities that the railroaders first confronted, which is that they are going to build the road bed essentially, and they're also going to be in the information business. It's not lost on them that if you own the rails and you're also shipping the cargo, you can get a really good deal on your rates. Other people may not get such a good deal, especially if they feel they are in competition.

This has given rise to a whole set of concerns and problems which the Electronic Frontier Foundation is now dealing with. EFF did not start out to be a traffic cop on the data superhighway. That wasn't our objective. At the time Mitchell Kapor and I started EFF we had a very narrow set of concerns. We thought that there were actions taking place on the part of the Government that made it clear that they didn't quite realize that speech was speech whether it was expressed in bits or ink on the page.

We felt that all we had to do was hire a few really scary civil liberties attorneys from New York, kick hell out of the Secret Service, dust our hands off in satisfaction, and go back to whatever it was we were doing. But we hadn't been at this very long when I got some electronic mail from a young fellow who was in what was still at that time the Soviet Union. He said, "I applaud what you and Mr. Kapor are doing in trying to insure that your First Amendment extends to Cyberspace, but what about us?" And we realized for the first time that in Cyberspace the First Amendment is a local ordinance.

That was a revelation to me, and also to Mitch. We started thinking about what had to be done on a structural rather than a legal level to make certain that people who connected to one another electronically would do so without fear of reprisal for the things that they might think and say. Mitch said something profound at one point: "Architecture is politics."

Now when I said that to something like the Academy of Television last week, they didn't have the slightest idea what I was talking about, but I'll bet the people in this room know that very well. It's a message that I think we need to start carrying to the world in a much more forward and pro-active way than is your natural bent.

I know that when I've talked to computer audiences in times past I've had a continuous question and complaint from people in the room who say, "Well, you know, you want me to behave as though I were a social philosopher and, actually what I do is bus architecture." Well, exactly. I don't think you can expect the social philosophers to understand bus architecture very well for a while either. So the job falls to you and the people who understand the basic nature of this very different environment.

When I was down in Los Angeles late last week, I attended something that some of you may of heard about. This was  "Superhighway Supersummit." You never saw such self-importance in your life. It was unbelievable.

This next anecdote has nothing to do with anything, except it's more evidence that I'm in a Thomas Pynchon novel. As a guest of the White House I had a packet which included a discrete little part which read, "Those persons who will be accompanied by a personal security assistant are reminded that their assistant may not carry his weapon while in the building." There were also two parking passes. One for regular cars, and one for limousines. So they knew a fair amount about the culture that they were pitching to down there.

The idea that this particular set of hooligans was going to be in charge of the future was terrifying to me, in spite of the fact that, to my surprise and satisfaction, I found people like John Malone saying all the right things. It was very gratifying to hear that the things that EFF was pretty much alone in saying two years ago were now politically correct.

But there is a great distance between being able to mouth the politically correct thing and the actually having the kind of consciousness that will promote those goals in a serious way. These folks are in business, they're not in it for their health.

I looked around that audience and I realized that what I was looking at was perhaps the ultimate expression of contemporary civilization. Which made me start to think. Mitch and I had always talked about the job of EFF as civilizing the electronic frontier. I think that our job, and your job, increasingly, is going to be frontierizing civilization.

I believe that as a species we have gone just about as far as we can go by design. If we are going to try to design society from the top, we will continue to have the sort of results that they had in the Soviet Union and at IBM.

The world is simply too complex a place to figure out. It's pretty good at figuring itself out as long as you have an extremely open architecture, or ecosystem, which supports ideas in a fluid and nutritious kind of way. That's one of the great geniuses of UNIX. I have a Next machine ... I expect a boo or two ... but that's as close to UNIX as I've been able to get. It's kind of like UNIX with training wheels by Armani.

I have no personal aspirations to write a lot of shell scripts. I still feel like C++ must be an exceptionally mediocre report card. But when I look at the development of UNIX over the course of its existence, I find it truly remarkable how this critter has grown. I sometimes think of it as being the 1990's equivalent of Chartres Cathedral, where thousands of people worked for many years creating something that was amazingly complex, and yet somehow worked rather elegantly to the purposes for which it had been created.

I look at UNIX as it continues to develop and I think that it will continue for a long time to be the genetic code of Cyberspace. You have to approach your work, I think, with that in mind. Of course the Government and the large entertainment and television bodies that are now getting into this really don't have a sense of how important it is to have an adaptive organism as your substrate. They are not approaching it from that angle.

I am pleased to say that among the things that Al Gore announced down in Los Angeles the other day had to do with opening up information infrastructure to competition. In the past, as you know, most of the information infrastructure in the United States was designed on the basis of a regulated monopoly. We had for many years a stranglehold on the part of AT&T which up until very recently was still requiring you to fill out a whole bunch of forms to put a suction cup on your telephone.

So I'm very grateful to Judge Green, who took a lot of flack at the time for having the insight to see that this stuff was going to develop much more rapidly and much more openly in the hands of a lot of different companies rather than one. The same thing is now starting to happen with regard to the impending train wreck between the cable industry and the telcos and the wireless industry.

These various industries have been regulated in the past by completely different regimes originating in completely different places. Most of the broadcasters have been regulated by the FCC ... and poorly, I might add. The telephone companies are regulated by state public utilities commissions, and most cable operators are regulated by municipalities. What they are trying to do is create a system whereby all these different media can come into direct competition with one another so that the path by which bits can get into your home or office are so repetitious and so open that competition brings down prices and creates bandwidth.

There is going to be, as you folks know well, an enormous desire for bandwidth, and a lot of different agencies are going to be engaged in fulfilling that desire. There will be plenty of business for them ... Bandwidth is one of those things kind of like money and sex ... the more you got the shorter it feels.

Demands for bandwidth will also grow as we start moving away from text. (Personally, I can hardly wait. I have a text allergy at this point. I get kind of an ASCII glaze at the end of the week after 5 days of 100 to 150 e-mail messages a day, each one of which I have to read in order to understand whether or not it's important to me. I want to see a lot of richer data that has the kind of semiotic format that tells me right away whether or not I want to mess with it, but it's going to take a lot of bandwidth to do that.)

In any case, there are several bills already in Congress which EFF has been pretty involved in helping create. There's the Markey bill, which is HR 3636, the National Communications Competition Information Infrastructure Act of 1993 which would make it possible for cable companies to provide telco services and visa-versa. And also make it possible for the national long distance carriers to compete with the RBOC's in local telecommunications.

There's another fairly similar bill in the Senate, the Telecommunications Infrastructure Act, which is being promoted by Inouye. As Vice President Gore announced on Tuesday, the administration is currently drafting an amendment to the Communications Act which would include a whole new section code called Title VII.

Title VII, if promulgated, would do something that seems pretty enlightened. It's a promotion of a lot of the principles that EFF has been talking about in Open Platform. It would essentially make it possible for telecommunications providers to enter into a fairly non-regulated regime if they were willing to ensure complete openness of whatever channel they were creating to whatever service or server might want to attach itself to it. There is a lot of emphasis being placed on making certain that the Data Superhighway is not 500 lanes in one direction and a foot path the other.

I can't tell you how important it is that these communications structures are designed to be full-duplex. This does not resonate with the culture of their builders, however. They don't know very much about getting that bit back from the consumer. They are understandably a little afraid of what will happen when the couch potatoes actually start to speak up about what has been smothering them from their glass tubes all these years. It may turn out that they don't really like this stuff very much and that they are not going to be pleased by 500 versions of the air channel for men or the ability to watch "My Mother the Car" at any hour of the day or night.

In spite of these fairly enlightened activities, I think that you will see that Congress is even more inclined than ever to act "in loco parentis." There are impending bills which would impose the necessity of having some kind of technological switch on your set top box that would sense incoming violent content and would just circumvent its entry into your home.

This is obviously pretty bone-headed, but these are the kinds of things we have to deal with. We have to make Congress and the various communications providers recognize that the best way to assure family values, for whatever family might be having those values, is to tag information in ways so that people can make their own choices. There are ways to do that that are not particularly demanding from the technical level. We do not need a society which protects us from our own words.

One of the great things about talking to you guys is that I don't have to go through a detailed history of the EFF or what we are doing. I know that many of you, who had a natural affinity for the work we did defending the freedom of speech in the very beginning, were baffled when we were suddenly became something that looked like a telco trade organization, started pushing ISDN, and dealing with telecommunications regulation. I think that we did that for prudent and sufficient reasons even if we didn't communicate those reasons very well to the outside.

I want to run down some of the fundamental aspects of Open Platform. We are trying to promote the idea that there needs to be common carriage, much as there has been through out the history of the telephone system. The phone company certainly didn't try to regulate content over its lines.

The problem here is that common carriage under the telephone model was protected by a regulatory regime which essentially gave a monopoly the right to go on being a monopoly ... and a lot of incentive to go on being a monopoly ... if they were to keep those lines open. Now it's a whole new ball game trying to come up with a model for common carriage which does not involve a regulatory overburden or monopolistic practices.  It's going to be a very significant challenge. We don't have all the answers by any means.

We have to work on interconnection and interoperability. When the fellow from Viacom told me that TCP/IP had too much overhead, as a non UNIX weenie, I didn't have a good response to him, except that it sounded to me vaguely like a religious, rather than a technological statement. Which I think it is. The people who know that and have sound evidence to prove it will have to work hard on these people for whom  such beliefs are a canon of faith.

You also need to be thinking about set top box and video architecture protocols that will make it very easy for the telcos and the information services to provide video over fairly cheap bandwidth. You need to help the Internet ramp up in a wise and orderly fashion. I know it's hard to do under the current system. We all saw what happened to the Internet as soon as Mosaic got out there. I'm somewhat concerned that if a lot more of this goes on it's going to be very difficult to get traffic across the Internet. There are some serious technical challenges. But there are things we can do to solve them.

There is a new initiative that EFF is just starting up. We're trying to work with the companies themselves, and these include some of the new Internet based companies, to convince them that there is a business advantage in allowing the people who connect to their system to use those connections for whatever purpose.

I don't want to pick on Rick Adams, whom I assume is here, but I think it's unfortunate that AlterNet and PSI and other commercial Internet providers have forbade their customers from using their facilities for such commercial services as bulletin boards. This is a debate that's going to have to be carried on among you folks who are on the Internet and use those providers. It may well be that you have to start looking to other IP providers are willing to open up their lines to real communication and not impose unnecessarily restrictive barriers to competition.

There is another set of issues that I think are going to be particularly troubling and difficult to solve. I refer to cryptography and the private protection of your data. The Government is really not even on the chart with this yet.

Parenthetically, I have to insert another Thomas Pynchon moment here. I had a really weird experience the other day. I managed to schmooze myself onto Air Force 2 and ride back up here to San Francisco with Al Gore. A great sense of unreality pervaded that experience for me, and the conversation with the Vice President which took place along the way. Al Gore is a good guy and a smart guy, but, when it comes to designing the National Information Infrastructure, he has been strictly focused on those issues around regulation and competition.

What he has apparently been thinking about very hard is cryptography. When I started to open this line of discussion he went all blank and said, "We have national security interests at stake." End of discussion.

I think we need to think long and hard about whether or not our national security interests are actually addressed by trying to impose export embargoes on cryptographic code. This strikes me as being like trying to impose export embargoes on wind.

You can get MacPGP or PGP from FTP sites all over the world in seconds, so I'm not quite sure what they are accomplishing, except that they are accomplishing a chilling effect on the ability of American corporations to incorporate robust cryptography into software and hardware which they might design. Obviously it doesn't make a lot of sense to build a system that incorporates levels of cryptographic protection that the NSA won't let you to ship overseas. You don't want to have to build one system for the United States and another system for overseas sales, especially in a business that exports as much of its product as we do in the hardware and software industries.

We have to get the Government to recognize the futility of crypto embargo. It would be nice if they could also recognize that the Cold War is over, but that may take some time. Even when they do figure that out: we still have to deal with their Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: kiddie pornographers, drug lords, terrorists, and unnamed foreign enemies.

These monsters are rattled out at me every time I suggest it would be a good idea to free up cryptography. I think they are all fairly illusory at this moment. Assuming that we have to shut down privacy in America because of terrorists doesn't make a lot of sense to me, when we only lost 6 of our citizens to terrorism last year. This is not quite the threat that the Government portrays it to be.

Really what we have going on, I think, is the NSA acting as a stalking horse for the FBI and other domestic law enforcement interests. They are scared to death they are going to lose their ability to wiretap as analog communications become some kind of digital fruit salad. They don't see ... and there may be a fortunate quality to this ... they don't see yet the technological opportunities that digitization will present them.

I think we need to analyze the problems and opportunities on both sides here and deal with them accordingly. We may be hurtling toward a future in which everything we do will be visible to the Government. As it is right now, any time you make a financial transaction you smear your fingerprints all over Cyberspace. This does not need to be the case, but it's going to take a lot of consciousness changing to have it be otherwise.

For example, when I was talking to Gore the other day, he boasted about how Government services were going to be a lot more efficient as the result of a centralized card that people could use to get any money that was owed them by the Government in disability payments, social security payments, or whatever. They could simply go to a kiosk and insert their card to get their payments. I asked him if there weren't some privacy considerations that went along with this. I drew a complete blank. So we have a serious problem.

By the same token, there are also serious problems to reckon with in giving cryptography to everybody. I'm not certain I'm completely sanguine with the idea that the advent of digital cash may create an economy in which taxes become voluntary. At first blush that seems immensely appealing to me. I'm sure it does to you too. But the problem with simply buying only as much government as you think you need is that the people who can afford government get it and the people who can't don't get it. You can see what's happening already in the delivery of a lot of vital services.

Education has become privatized at the top. Mail has become privatized at the top. I don't know anyone with an income of more than $50,000 who uses the Postal Service when they want to send a package. They use Federal Express or UPS.

The rich even have their own police. If you go down to Los Angeles, which I guess you won't be able to do for a few days \[there had been an earthquake there that morning\], you will find that in the wealthier parts of Los Angeles, the local established government supported police force is not a major element. The real police come from Westec. It's like something out of "Snow Crash."

I think that we have to do something to detach financial transaction from identity, or we are going to be in a serious mess. While I believe that the current Government is, for all of its ineptitude, relatively benign, I'm not sure I trust it with the power network-wide transactional analysis might endow it with. As Lord Acton said, "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." When the Government can see every single thing that we're up to, I think that conveys to them a level of power that I'm not going to be comfortable with they're having.

I don't think you should be.

There is also a whole set of extremely knotty questions about intellectual property we're going to have to deal with. Again I'm pleased that I don't have to explain to this audience that the digitization of everything presents us with certain intellectual property challenges. You know a lot about this. Believe me, the people in traditional media do not. We are entering a situation where the primary article of commerce looks a hell of a lot like speech.

Given the ambiguity of property law in this area, I think it's almost impossible for us to say that free speech is assured when proprietary interests will try to control its transport for their own economic purposes. There is going to be a lot of that. There already is a lot of that. There are other aspects of this that are more inconvenient than threatening, but I don't see how we're going to avoid a complete collapse of technological progress if we continue to put patents on things like cursors.

I'm sure that many of you work for companies that now feel obligated to patent every thought that happens to gel up in your head. I believe you have to think about how you can serve Caesar, and at the same time, serve the collective good of humanity. I am convinced that a lot of those thoughts really are the collective property of humanity. Somebody once said that art is what happens when God speaks through a human being. I believe there's some truth to that. so it may be bold and arrogant to claim whatever appears in your head. I think it's there for everyone. That's my own personal belief and I'm sure I can get a good argument out of somebody on that point.

When I discussed the intellectual property dilemma with Gore on the plane the other day he said, "You're a songwriter and you must know that there is already a system operating that deals in intellectual property that doesn't have some physical manifestation, and that is BMI and ASCAP."

I said, "I'm a member of ASCAP, and if you think that's the solution, I invite you to write some songs." ASCAP and BMI have a system for extracting royalty payments from radio and television stations and distributing to their members which is so disorganized and disorganizable that I look at ASCAP payments as being kind of like manna.

When I get a check from ASCAP I think, well, that's nice. I wonder if it reflects anything real about actual radio play or television broadcasts. I suspect not because they way they monitor air play is to have people walking around with randomly selected tapes of radio broadcasts on their Walkmans, writing down every song they hear and coming up with some very crude statistical reckoning of these samples mean in terms of actual air play. This is a sloppy system.

I think there are going to be other systems of intellectual property protection which evolve, probably based on something more like a performance model or a service model than instantiation in some physical widget.

Those things are all going to go away and we're going to have to figure out how to sell the wine of intellectual property without any bottles we've been putting it in. I think that we probably will come up with something. I can't imagine we're going to get very far into the Information Age without any way of being paid for the work that we do with our minds.

We're going to have to change our perceived relationship with intellectual property from one based on ownership to one based on performance and service. We're going to have to look at ourselves in a continuous relationship with the people who use our work rather than saying, "Alright, I put my work in this box and the next time I give you this box it's going to be a whole new transaction."

All of this is going to involve some fairly profound economic and social changes. About the only thing I'm willing to say about them today is that any projection made from this vantage point is liable to look ridiculous in ten years. Everything is going to change very much. I really feel that what we are essentially doing here is roughly like what the French theologian philosopher Teilhard de Chardin was talking about when he started to write in the thirties about the Omega point ... that point at which human beings became so good at communicating with one another that they would create what would amount to a great Collective Organism of Mind.

I think we are going to become such a creature. Perhaps we already are. It is a very different kind of creature than has ever been seen in the universe before. It will be enormously powerful and intelligent. And you folks are helping it be born. Thank you very much.

TV, LSD, and Life in the Country
================================

by John Perry Barlow

To the Pinedale Roundup, Pinedale Wyoming:

Sublette County, hang your head and cry!

Last week (Feb. 3-7 I don't remember the exact day now) on National TV's noon program "Closer Look", hosted by Faith Daniels. The subject was the increasing popularity of the 80's and 70's designer hallucinogen, LSD. The guests were a young man that had used LSD, a man whose son was killed because he used LSD, and a man who thought LSD use was O.K. That man, Sublette County, was John Perry Barlow. He sat right there on National TV and said he supported the use of LSD, and the last time he used it himself was last November.

What a fine representative of our wonderful piece of country and the people in it. Will LSD users be tempted to come to Sublette County, thinking this is a good place to practice their drug habits with the approval of the residents. And what about the young people (and the not so young, such as Mr. Barlow) in the county. Is this the example and role model for them to look to and build their values on? A native son and a LSD user. What about it Sublette County? Wipe the tears from your eyes so you can see clearly and find some good role models so the kids can choose strong, clean values. They are the future of our country and nation. Hold up for them something or someone with something more than what Mr. Barlow represents.

<unsigned> Idaho Falls, Idaho

To which I have replied as follows:

Fellow Citizens of Sublette County,

When I agreed to appear on A Closer Look, I had a hunch that, sooner or later, there'd arise a call to protect yourselves such perils as me. It's encouraging, though not surprising, that my only denunciation came from outside Pinedale. Tolerance is one of the things I love about this place.

For these and other reasons,  I intend to go on living here, so I figure I owe you an explanation.

NBC invited me on the show in my capacity as a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, an institution long associated with LSD. I was not there to defend (and certainly not to recommend) its use to anyone. That is a personal, even spiritual, matter.

I accepted their offer, with grave misgivings, because I care about free speech.

Over the last 25 years, I've watched a lot of Deadheads do acid. It is the sacrament of their community. I've taken it myself. I still do occasionally, in a ritual sort of way. On the basis of their experience and my own, I know that the public terror of LSD is based more on media-propagated superstition than familiarity with its effects on the real world.

I know this, and, like most others who know it, I have kept quiet about it.

But I've finally realized that if I continue, out of fear, to conceal what I believe in this or any other area of public interest, I  participate in a growing threat to the minds of America's young greater than any which acid presents. I mean by that the establishment of permissible truth in America. In a word, totalitarianism.

Shortly after the Bill of Rights was drafted, English Philosopher John Stuart Mill said, "Liberty resides in the rights of that person whose views you find most odious."

I will go further and say that liberty resides in its exercise. It is preserved in the actual spouting of those odious views. It is maintained, and always has been, by brave and lonely cranks.

Lately, it seems our necessary cranks have been falling silent, struck dumb by a general assault on liberty on America. This is no right wing plot from the top. Like most totalitarian impulses, it has arisen among the people themselves. Terrified of virtual bogeymen we know only from the Evening News, we have asked the government for shorter chains and smaller cages. And, market driven as ever, it has been obliging us.

This is what is now taking place in our conduct of The War On Some Drugs. In this futile Jihad, Americans have largely suspended habeas corpus, have allowed government to permanently confiscate our goods without indictment or trial, have flat discarded the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and are voluntarily crippling the First, at least insofar as any expression might relate to drugs.

In my gloomier moments, I wonder if the elimination of freedom in America is not what the War On Some Drugs was actually designed to accomplish.

Certainly we haven't engaged this campaign because the psychoactive substances we so determined to eliminate are inherently more dangerous than those we keep in plentiful and legal supply. Indeed, the most dangerous, anti-social, and addictive drugs I've ever taken...the ones I'm afraid to touch in any quantity today...are all legal.

Alcohol, nicotine, and prescription sedatives do more American damage every day than LSD has done since it was derived in 1942. Each year, alcohol kills hundreds of thousands of Americans, many of them violently. It is a factor in most murders and suicides in America. It is a rare case of domestic violence or abuse where alcohol plays no role, especially here in Sublette County, where domestic pathology and alcohol addiction are as common and united as jello and whipped cream.

Yet I don't hear people calling for its prohibition, nor would I support such an effort. I know it won't work.

It's not working for LSD either and it's even less likely to. Lysergic Acid Diethylamide-25 is active in doses so small you can't see them. It's colorless, odorless, and it doesn't show up in drug tests. And you have to be pretty high on acid before anyone's going to notice you being anything but extremely alert.

Does this mean that I think LSD is safe or that I am recommending its use? Hardly. My accuser's allegations notwithstanding, I was careful to point out on A Closer Look that I consider LSD to be a serious medicine. Hey, this stuff can make some people see God. Now that's serious medicine.

I tried to convey two points there. First, by diminishing the hazards inherent in our cultural drugs of choice and demonizing psychedelics, we head our children straight down the most dangerous path their youthful adventurism can take.

Second, LSD is dangerous but not in the ways generally portrayed. By dressing it up in a Halloween costume of fictitious dangers, we encourage our kids to think we were also lying about its real ones. And LSD is dangerous.

It is dangerous  because it promotes the idea that reality is something to be manipulated rather than accepted. This notion can seriously cripple one's coping abilities, though I would still suggest that both alcohol and TV advertising carry it more persuasively than LSD.  And of course, if you're lightly-sprung, it can leave you nuts.

But LSD is not illegal because it endangers your sanity. Halcion has a clinically demonstrated ability to cause violent psychotic episodes, and it's so legal that President Bush uses it.

LSD is illegal because it endangers Control. Worse, it makes authority seem funny. But laugh at authority in America and you will know risk. LSD is illegal primarily because it threatens the dominant American culture, the culture of Control.

This is not a sound use of law. Just laws arise to support the ethics of a whole society and not as a means for one of its cultural factions to impose power on another.

If you think this is a necessary exception, consider that there is a rapidly growing segment in this country who consider big game hunting to be murder. At present expansion rates, it is not so hard to imagine them a majority someday.

So, before you dish out as law your own cultural prejudices, consider what you might one day get to eat according to that principle.

There are probably 25 million Americans who have taken LSD, and who would, if hard pressed in private, also tell you that it profoundly changed their lives, and not necessarily for the worse.

I will readily grant that some of these are hopeless crystal worshippers or psychedelic derelicts creeping around Oregon woods. But far more of them are successful members of society, CEO's, politicians, ministers, and community leaders.

This is true. Whether we want it to be or not.

But the fact that so few among these millions dare utter this truth is, in a supposedly free country, a symptom of collective mental illness.

I neither expect nor ask any young person to regard me as a role model. There are easier routes through this world than the one I've taken. But I do like to think of myself as someone who defends his convictions.

And I hope to raise three daughters who are brave enough to own their beliefs, no matter how unorthodox, and to own them in public, no matter how risky. I dream of a day when anyone's daughters will feel free to do that.

The most I can do toward a world in which their liberty is assured is to exercise mine in this one.

In hope of your continued tolerance,

John Perry Barlow

The Pursuit of Emptiness: Why Americans Have Never Been A Happy Bunch
=====================================================================

Forbes ASAP, 12.03.01

_Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness._

_-Chuang-tzu (369-286 B.C.)_

Extolling the pursuit of happiness was a toxic stupidity entirely unworthy of my greatest American hero, Thomas Jefferson. Indeed, the pursuit is a poison that sickens our culture. I wish he'd never said it.

It produces a monstrous, insatiable hunger inside our national psyche that encourages us to ravenously devour the resources of this small planet, crushing liberties, snuffing lives, feeling ourselves ordained by God and Jefferson to do whatever is necessary to make us happy.

During the year 2000, while feeding at the greatest economic pig trough the world has ever slopped forth, Americans ate $10.2 billion worth of Prozac and other antidepressants (up 19.5% from the previous year). Better living through chemistry? I don't think so. I have never heard any of my friends and acquaintances who have become citizens of the Prozac Nation claim that these drugs bring them any closer to actual happiness. Rather, they murmur with listless gratitude that antidepressants have pulled them back from the Abyss. They are not pursuing happiness; they are fleeing suicide.

Not until I turned 30 did it become apparent that my wariness of the pursuit of happiness might be a subtle form of treason. Like many of my generation, I hadn't expected to live to such an age. I really didn't trust anyone over 30, and remain reluctant to do so even now. But since I was about to become an adult, I figured I ought to take a stab at graceful adulthood.

So I spent the night before my 30th birthday composing a list called "Principles of Adult Behavior." Most of my self-directed advice consisted of such platitudes as Polonius liked to lay on Hamlet--stuff like "Expand your sense of the possible" and "Tolerate ambiguity."

But there was a patch in the middle of this earnest document that nearly every American who read it bottomed out on. And that was No. 15, which stated: "Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that."

Despite the safely Puritan kicker, this homily pissed off the broadest range of folks you can imagine. Whether hippie, cowboy, redneck, or debutante, practically everyone who read it thought there was something threateningly wrong with it. It was downright un-American. Why?

Because nearly everyone in this country feels the weird, invisible pressure to pursue happiness; they feel that secret shame of not trying hard enough to attain it. To have someone tell them they should just stop trying felt like a threat to an oath they'd taken. In other words, Jefferson's wistful aspiration has gradually transmuted into first an entitlement and eventually an obligation, even as its actual practice has become increasingly rare. Listen carefully for the sound of spontaneous laughter in America's public places. Observe random American faces for the sight of a smile. You will be alarmed, I think, at how infrequently we are illuminated by such natural human light. And yet, behind these grim masks, there continues to reside the guilty belief that happiness is ordained by Jefferson (and possibly God) to be our duty.

Ask an American how he's doing, even in these times of pandemic chaos and fear, and he will instinctively reply, "Fine."

Yeah, right.

Let me be clear. I like happiness. Hell, I think I am happy most of the time. And why, when I'm happy, am I happy? Never because I pursued happiness but rather because I let it pursue me. To me, the more you ignore happiness, the more it will come looking. Swami Satchidananda of India put it better: "If you run after things, nothing will come to you. Let things run after you. The sea never sends an invitation to the rivers. That's why they run to the sea. The sea is content. It doesn't want anything. That's the secret in life."

In Africa, the Zulu have a word, ubunto, which is often translated to mean community, but I've heard a more accurate definition: "I am because we are; we are because I am." In other words, happiness is not a solitary endeavor; it's a joint enterprise, something that can only be created by the whole. I am happy because we are happy. Contentment arises from a sense of family, community, and connectedness.

Such virtues are in dwindling supply in America. Close to half of first marriages end in divorce. The war between children and parents has never been uglier. We ridiculously imagine that America Online and the local mall are communities. And to the extent that we are connected at all, it is largely by mass media like television, which, as Bertrand Russell pointed out, "allows thousands of people to laugh at the same joke and still remain alone."

Do we Americans lack this sense of connectedness because of our affluence? Does wealth induce loneliness? I don't think so. But to address the problem, we first have to admit that it exists. This will not be easy. Many of us are convinced that our sorrows are a sign of personal deficiency. Thinking that we are alone in our politically incorrect despair only drives us deeper into personal isolation.

But more to the point, we need to rethink some of the basic assumptions of the industrial economy. Chief among these is the idea that there is a natural division between our lives and our livelihoods. The first thing we learn in school is that it's supposed to suck. Learning is work, and we fully expect that the work we do in later life will make us equally miserable. We render unto Caesar for eight dreary hours every day, during which we expect not to be ourselves but rather interchangeable machine parts in some great industrial engine.

This doesn't have to be the case. I was a cattle rancher for 17 years, during which there was no discernable division between my life and my work. It was cold, arduous, and involved constant contact with actual bullshit, but I loved it. Following my realization that ranching had become a lifestyle that only the already wealthy could afford, I turned to thinking for a living. This is also hard, and there is plenty of bullshit involved, but I can only do it as myself. Yet most organizations still require their "knowledge workers" to be as self-alienated as lathe operators. There was a glimmer of hope in the dot-com startups, but these have either failed or become big enough to assume the isolating social practices of their industrial predecessors.

Better still, there has never in history been such an abundance of young people who have already experienced the futility of wealth. They spent a couple of years pursuing IPOs that would "release" them to a lifetime of starlet-chasing on the Riviera. Now many of them are more dedicated to making a difference than to making a dollar.

Which brings me to another solace still available to us. Consider the joys of service. As a few leaders, ranging from Jimmy Carter to the Dalai Lama, demonstrate, we can become happy through the exercise of compassion. But following the training we receive in schools and workplaces, we have come to regard service as a self-suppressing obligation rather than a self-fulfilling responsibility. It doesn't have to be that way.

Perhaps, in the wake of the September 11 massacre, this is changing. Now, hundreds of thousands have experienced the obscure delight of donating blood. Millions more are finding, in the presence of such loss and terror, what really matters. Love can thrive in the presence of fear. As a society, we are well positioned to both love and accept love.

All this doesn't mean that happiness can only be found through connectedness. You can find happiness when you are alone. Sometimes I think of something Kafka--that noted happiness-hound--wrote:

> It is not necessary that you leave the house. Remain at your table and listen. Do not even listen, only wait. Do not even wait, be wholly still and alone. The world will present itself to you for its unmasking, it can do no other, in ecstasy it will writhe at your feet.

Kafka is not talking about the pursuit of happiness. He's not even talking, as one might easily and incorrectly conclude, about lying in wait for happiness. He's talking about making yourself genuinely available to it. Opening yourself to the little things: the sunrises, the lilac-scented breezes, the hilarious bartender jokes, the inside straights, the large purring cats, the click of stiletto heels, the very granular texture of unsolicited joy.

Worry. Be happy. But remember that happiness is a gift you owe yourself. It is not an obligation you owe to Jefferson, the United States, or God Itself.

The View from the Brooklyn Bridge
=================================

In response to "The Five Imperatives for Electronic Trade"

John Perry Barlow Co-Founder, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Advisory Board Member, CSC Vanguard

Last week, I took a Dutch friend on a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and submitted her to an extemporaneous lecture on the parallels between that literal and genuinely religious leap of faith in 19th-century American engineering and the Internet as the current manifestation of the same wild thrust, engendering some of the same popular anxieties.

I told her that I thought the decade in which it was designed and largely built, the 1870s, was a decade which in some ways resembles the present. It was a time of shattering invention and originality. Many of the technologies that would utterly alter us during the intervening century - the telephone, commercial electricity, sound recording, and steel construction - exploded into the world.

It was another time when engineering suddenly endowed us with apparently limitless potential. The prophets of that time - from Marx to Edison to the Roeblings, father and son - were as feverish with the inevitability of their visions as the Tofflers and cypherpunks of the present.. And, as Larry says, many of the ordinary folks were scared to death of a future which they could neither prevent nor understand.

As symbols, there are some important differences between the Brooklyn Bridge and Internet though, many of them related to the sources and advantages of faith. These were brought into sharp focus at the privacy and security conference in Palm Springs, and I've been mulling them over ever since.

Faith in the Known

The Promethean engineers of the 19th century were thrust upward on Toffler's Second Wave at the time of its maximum velocity. They were in a matrix of progressive zeal that spread from the crisp vertices of Descartes to the vanishing points of Manifest Destiny. They believed in Control, and, of course, Almighty God, by whom Control had been ordained and in whose name it was imposed.

The Roeblings' bridge may have terrified the hoi polloi, but to the men who financed it, it was a reasonable statement of faith in physics - the most dramatic of its time perhaps - but well within the confines of a paradigm that had been bearing steadily increasing fruit since Newton and, in many ways, since Moses.

Further, the Brooklyn Bridge undermined none of the institutions of its day. Indeed, it was part of what was building them. Coming out of an era in which the only large institutions had been religious in the classical sense, it represented both the Church and its new siblings, the Corporation and Large Government. It's no mistake that its arches ascend to an ecclesiastical point.

If you walk across the bridge today, you feel its blunt simplicity. In addition to stone and steel, it was made of physics. And physics, at least Newtonian physics, is a lot simpler than biology. Once you've done the math, you can trust the trajectory.

It was also, as Larry suggests, made of faith, but it was a very different kind of faith than the present asks of us. Where the Brooklyn Bridge was built on faith in what was known and controllable, we are now required to place our trust in what can neither be known nor controlled.

Faith in the Unknown

We have left the Machine Age and are plunging into the fogbank of something completely different, the Era of the Organism. The new masterworks of humanity,  of which the Net is very likely the most important, are of such complexity that they can no longer be designed and built. Instead they must be grown. It isn't physics. It's biology. It's nature.

There are no smooth, catenary curves in nature. The trajectories of biology are forky and unpredictable as lightning. There is a new mathematics to describe them, but what these numbers tell you is only that you can't know where things are headed. It's hard to imagine the Brooklyn Bridge would have been funded had it been designed according to fractal geometry rather than calculus.

The current hurdle of civilization into cyberspace has required, like the bridge, the assembled acts of the existing institutions, but it hardly reaffirms them. For one thing, large collective enterprise loves certainty above all other things, including profit.

In the pursuit of certainty, almost any established corporation will follow the Devil It Knows, whether buggy-whips or minicomputers, straight to doom. Nothing is certain in cyberspace but accelerating change. The curves we can plot - processor speed, Internet growth, Web use, bandwidth - are all increasing logarithmically or faster. Furthermore, there is reason to think many of them will become irrelevant in this new environment, devoted as they are to distributing centralized goods and services.

For this reason, it is hardly surprising that many of the corporations that were putting us up at the corner of Dinah Shore Drive and Bob Hope Way resist going into Cyberspace. In some deep, organic recognition of their own, they know there be dragons there. They have a sense of nameless dread.

Of course, dread hates to be nameless so, in this instance, it finds its focus in the Nightmare Hacker, bent on lobotomizing corporations for the hell of it. Never mind that there is no evidence with which I'm familiar that this beast actually exists. He is a creature of the unfamiliar. The premise that he could exist is sufficient reason to stay out of this mysterious realm.

If corporations must go into Cyberspace, they insist on doing so with certainty and control assured. They want the government to send in troops first and ferret out such guerrillas as Kevin Mitnick and his kind. They want to establish the predictable rule of law. But this isn't Panama. It's more like Vietnam but worse, since the threat is largely imaginary (and thus impossible to contain). It's also worse because this jungle is infinitely expansible, and worse still, it's not even clear whose troops should go in or whose law should reign.

Faith in Openness

This relates to another of Larry's statements that I found telepathic: "What if Cyberspace isn't in the United States, or any country at all, but rather exists as its own, sovereign, virtual nation? Worse, what if cyberspace is in fact the home country of all global businesses?" When I read these lines, I was fresh from giving a speech at the TED conference in Monterey in which I had proposed precisely that.

In the created world that arose from Newton, power was derived from closed architectures of one sort or another. Creating wealth was a matter of skillfully managing scarcity and maintaining clear boundaries. But the natural world favors open systems. Indeed, it requires them, since the energy exchange processes upon which it builds its increasing layers of complexity must be interoperable in the deepest sense of the word. The Net is no different.

As I listened to Bill Cheswick, I realized that he was describing a system of such perfected security as to be fundamentally incompatible with the requirements of both the Internet and the World Wide Web, both of which need highly permeable membranes in the systems that make them up. The only way they can interact properly with their environment and maintain the security of their contents is through the internal use of cryptography, but this is another technology that existing institutions find threatening.

Then there are the threats to the control of intellectual "property" upon which many existing institutions have based their sense of well-being. If they cannot assure their ability to "own content," and there is no longer a business to be had in putting their intellectual property into objects and shipping it around in trucks, then what will they do for a living? Hard questions.

But can anyone not explicitly involved in the local manufacture of physical goods expect to be successful without entering this great region of ambiguity? I don't think so. We are at one of the great watersheds of history, a more momentous moment than the Brooklyn Bridge. All of us, whether individuals or institutions, will be required to make enormous acts of faith and leave our old beliefs at the border. Those who can't will be left behind.

But where the Brooklyn Bridge required of its builders faith in their ability to control technology, going into cyberspace demands a much purer form of faith: faith without control. Faith in nature. Faith in human nature. Faith that what goes around really does come around. Groundless faith.

But I have often suspected that groundless faith, like unconditional love, is the only kind there is.

Thinking locally, acting globally

ESSAY

By John Perry Barlow

THINKING LOCALLY, ACTING GLOBALLY

An ex-cowboy and rock lyricist turned Internet activist takes on the censors of cyberspace

Two weeks ago, a prosecutor in Munich managed, almost casually, to strike a global blow against freedom of expression. Though he is a person of such obscurity that most of the accounts I've read of this incident didn't even mention his name, he has been able to constrict the information flow for some 4 million people in 140 countries.

He did this merely by telling CompuServe, the world's second largest online-service provider, that it was breaking Bavarian law by giving Germans access to Usenet discussion groups believed to include explicit sexuality. A strangely terrified CompuServe responded by removing any newsgroups whose title contained the word sex, gay or erotic, thus blocking access to all subscribers, not just those in Germany. Given the centralized nature of its operations-and the decentralized nature of Usenet-this was, according to CompuServe, the only way it could comply.

Thus were CompuServe subscribers prevented from further discourse on whatever they talk about in alt.sex.bestiality.hamster.duct-tape (which may exceed even my high squeamishness threshold). At the same time, however, they were also barred from alt.religion.sexuality (a pretty chaste topic), clari.news.sex (which redistributes wire-service stories) and alt.sex.marsha-clark (the mind reels =8A).

Once again, the jackboots of the Industrial Era can be heard stomping cluelessly around the Infobahn. In fact, the Germans did almost nothing to stanch the flow of sexual materials. The newsgroups that CompuServe removed are still active on millions of computers worldwide. CompuServe subscribers in Bavaria or anywhere else can simply switch to a less timid online service and re-enter the discussion. As Internet pioneer John Gilmore once said, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."

Such assaults are most likely to injure the large service providers, sober institutions more culturally attuned to their governmental attackers than the info-guerrillas of cyberspace. CompuServe, for its cowardice in folding without a fight, probably deserves the calumny heaped on it by angry users. The company says it hopes to reopen access to all but its German subscribers as soon as it can figure out how.

But the issue at stake here is larger than whether the good people of Munich can prevent others half a world away from looking at pictures of sexually misused hamsters. These apparently trivial struggles may in fact be the opening fissures of a historical discontinuity.

The real issue is control. The Internet is too widespread to be easily dominated by any single government. By creating a seamless global-economic zone, borderless and unregulatable, the Internet calls into question the very idea of a nation-state. No wonder nation-states are rushing to get their levers of control into cyberspace while less than 1% of the world's population is online.

What the Net offers is the promise of a new social space, global and antisovereign, within which anybody, anywhere can express to the rest of humanity whatever he or she believes without fear. There is in these new media a foreshadowing of the intellectual and economic liberty that might undo all the authoritarian powers on earth.

That's why Germany, the People's Republic of China and the U.S. are girding to fight the Net, using the popular distaste for prurience as their longest lever. After all, who is willing to defend depictions of sexual intercourse with children and animals? Moving through the U.S. Congress right now is a telecommunications-reform bill that would impose fines of as much as $100,000 for "indecency" in cyberspace. Indecent (as opposed to obscene) material is clearly protected in print by the First Amendment, and a large percentage of the printed material currently available to Americans, whether it be James Joyce's Ulysses or much of what's in Cosmopolitan magazine, could be called indecent. As would my saying, right here, right now, that this bill is full of shit.

Somehow Americans lost such protections in broadcast media, where coarse language is strictly regulated. The bill would hold expression on the Net to the same standards of purity, using far harsher criminal sanctions-including jail terms-to enforce them. Moreover, it would attempt to impose those standards on every human who communicates electronically, whether in Memphis or Mongolia. Sounds crazy, but it's true.

If the U.S. succeeds in censoring the Net, it will be in a position to achieve far more than smut reduction. Any system of control that can stop us from writing dirty words online is a system that can control our collective conversation in other, more important ways. If the nation-states perfect such methods, they may own enough of the mind of mankind to perpetuate themselves far beyond their usefulness.

If that sounds overstated to you, consider the millions of people one prosecutor in Germany was able to mute with little more than an implied threat.

Through Many Panes of Shattered Glass
=====================================

Random Scenes from The Capitalist Fool Tour of Eastern Europe

In late October of last year, I found myself descending though the unscrubbed auburn over Budapest, Hungary in a Canadair Challenger bizjet. I had just made a trans-Atlantic crossing of such painlessness that I will evermore regard Coach as an insufferable purgatory.

The Challenger is the most sybaritic form of transportation since the sedan chair, over which it has several advantages: a top speed of .95 Mach, a transoceanic range, and an absence of slaves who might turn murderously upon their cargo.  Furthermore, if one has a developed sense of irony, it is about the best conveyance for tooling around the emerging Free Market of Eastern Europe.

There is also something about this aircraft which can temporarily alter a person's politics.  Watching someone get in it and fly away induces a reflexive Marxism.  But getting in it and flying away oneself will make a capitalist of you faster than anything short of a large quantity of capital. Aboard the plane with me were three software entrepreneurs whose capitalism had already been well-established by the latter means, even if they came to it by circuitous routes.

Our leader was Mitch Kapor.  He had scraped through the 70's as a psychiatric counselor, meditation instructor, Apple II consultant, and stand-up comic.  But he began the Capitalist's Decade by creating Lotus 1-2-3, the spreadsheet that wound up 10 million bizdroids.  Being the most popular chunk of computer code ever compiled, Lotus also became a cornucopia from which flowed many bounties.

Another of us was Nat Goldhaber, the developer of TOPS, the most popular software for networking Macintoshes.  When I had first heard the full name of TOPS, Transcendental Operating System, I assumed that "Transcendental"was, in this usage, some kind of computer term.  Later, I learned that, among his other odd accomplishments, Nat had founded Maharishi University.

The third was David Cole, an Hawaiian whose self-admitted style of "guerrilla management" had, during the 3 years he was CEO of  Ashton-Tate, transformed it from a software garage into a company which owned 70% of the database market and was the world's third largest purveyor of code (after Lotus and Microsoft).

My own capitalist credentials were far more modest.  I had put in 17 years as a agricultural businessman before succumbing to the million dollar debt which I inherited along with the ranch.  While this may have endowed me with longer business experience than any of my colleagues, my relationship with capital had always been inverse.

David took a look around the luxurious cabin of the Challenger and called us the Capitalist Fools.  For a variety of good reasons, the name stuck.

We had in common a set of neo-60's attributes ranging from the adipose baggage of incipient middle age to an annealed but still-active sense of faith and mission.  We had come, as we usually did, to save the world...or at least whatever tiny bit of it would yield to our efforts.

We had also come because Esther Dyson, the computer pundit and arbiter of developing technology, had assembled a gathering in Budapest between successful digital entrepreneurs from the West and Eastern aspirants now emerging from the great stone of socialism.  They were equipped with extraordinary talents in math and science and a desire to convert those talents into globally credible currency.  As it turned out, neither side knew much about how to make that happen.

The conference took place in the Budapest Hyatt, a plywood replica of similar businessmen's paradises in the West.  Like much of Eastern Europe, it looked better at a distance than close up, but it demonstrated a studious attention to the aesthetic forms of Transnational Corporatism.

It is located on the Pest shore of the reeking Danube directly across from the Citadel of Buda, whose heights are crowned by a magnificent collection of ancient national buildings, including the cathedral and the Royal Palace.

The latter was destroyed during the Second World War and then rebuilt.  I thought it odd that communists would rebuild a palace and asked our driver about it.  "The leadership must be there," said David Cole.

"No," said the driver, "It's a state museum."

"Right," said David, "the leadership must be there."

He had a point.  Even after it's supposed liberation, one gets the sense that Hungary is governed by curators.  And there is a lot of history to sift through, so much that it seems to fill the Hungarian consciousness with a permanent goulash of ambiguities, contradictions, and solid reasons for reserving judgement.

Budapest is a laminate of historical depositions going back to the 5th Century when Attila and his Black Huns moved in from southern Russia and created one of the first post-Roman empires there.  After Attila, there sloshed over Budapest tides of White Huns, Mongols, Ottoman Turks, Austrians, Nazis, Stalinists, and now, a weird alliance of rock stars and businessmen.

It seemed as if each new incursion had laid another pane of cultural glass over the local Magyars, shattering but leaving in place the one it covered. By now, the people of Budapest peer up toward the light of What Really Is through many splintered realities, each of which had once claimed ideological perfection.  It makes them wary.  But it also gives them a richness and resonant depth which made me feel about as complex as Dan Quale.

The most recent layers are characterized by three forms of graffiti. First, one sees the bullet pox which can be found on practically every building built before 1956.  When the Soviets clanked in to the quell the Uprising of that year, they hosed down Budapest with such a storm of lead that the result on its stone face looks almost geological.  In the course of two weeks they may have murdered as many as 30,000 Hungarians.  The living left the scars as a silent monument to a catastrophe they could not publicly mourn.

The second form is a kind of aerosol iconography, the spray-painted names of rock bands and lyric scraps, anarchist symbols, and post-modern English phrases like "Rhythmic Stress."  The handwriting of the Global Teenager.  I saw one heroic Austro-Hungarian monument, displaying both its old machine gun wounds and the words "Sid Vicious" scrawled large across its plinth. Around it loitered blue-jeaned kids who reminded me far more of myself in 1967 than contemporary American mall rats do.

Finally, there are advertising posters pasted everywhere, attesting to a commercial enthusiasm which makes one think of 19th Century America.  The most common face on public display, replacing Lenin throughout the Eastern Bloc, is my old pal and horse-trading partner Darrel Winfield, the Marlboro Man.  He is followed closely by Barbie (the doll) and an ashram-ful of gurus, mystics, and spiritual healers.  Even Maharaji, now presumably the Perfect Thirtysomething-ish Guru, is making a major comeback in the East.

Also big were the two Ronalds, Reagan and McDonald.  What appeared to be the most fashionable hang-out in town was found beneath the Golden Arches. The popularity of a very superficial form of Laissez-faire was familiar to anyone who had endured the Reagan era.

These developments notwithstanding, I realized that my economic expectations of Eastern Europe, based on media mythology and a 20 year-old memory of East Germany, had been far too morbid.  There was evidence everywhere of an affluence of considerably longer standing than anything the last year could have produced.  Though I have been told that Eastern Europe is experiencing an outbreak of homelessness, there was none of the poverty visible in any American city. Consumer goods were fairly abundant, buildings were painted and well-maintained, the people were universally dressed as though middle class.

While this was more the case in Hungary, which has been experimenting with free market economic principals for about a decade, than elsewhere, there was a general marked contrast to the dowdy communist gray I had expected.

There were other positive surprises.  As Mitch, Nat, David, and I strolled the streets of Pest, we were in the company of thousands of other cheerful amblers who filled the streets from sidewalk to sidewalk.  Budapest, like Prague, is a community on foot. There is a social warmth and collegiality to this perambulation which is entirely missing in any but the smallest American towns.

This may be largely due to the scarcity of anything one might seriously call an automobile, combined with the community which always arises through shared adversity.  There is likely something more humanizing about waiting in line than waiting in traffic.

But I kept having the nagging sense that some of this collective good will arose from aspects of communism having actually worked according to spec. This was not a very comforting thought to someone whose youthful Marxism had hardened into Republicanism twenty years ago.  (Indeed, most of it had departed me quite suddenly on that morning in '68 when I rode my BMW into Czechoslovakia as Russian tanks rolled in from the other direction.)

I couldn't tell whether the egalitarian coziness I saw in those streets would be an inevitable victim of remorseless commerce but there seemed no question that it would be placed at risk.  It would not be enough to cast out communism.  The new challenge appeared to be the development of Capitalism with a Human Face.

Das Kapital Redux

At the conference, it became apparent that the development of any sort capitalism would be a more complex undertaking than Time Magazine would have one believe.  Despite a rich finish of bonhomie and outward similarity, the perceptual differences between the entrepreneurs were profound.  And again, many of those difference appeared to be the result of communism having worked better than thought...not so much as an economic system, where it had obviously failed, but as a method of creating social ethics that would be hard to shake.

A number of fundamental business concepts seemed frankly repugnant.  The idea, for example, that one might enter into a deal with the knowledge that he would win while his opposite number lost was not considered a moral concept.  Profit translated into exploitation.  But an unwillingness to exploit, however laudable, increases one's chances of becoming an object of prey himself.

One Soviet "company" called ParaGraph provided an excellent case in point. ParaGraph had arisen like a grave worm in the morbid body of something called the Soviet Institute of Mathematical Methods in Economics.  Possibly looking for something useful to pass their time with, a little group of them had started developing commercial software.

Despite its bureaucratic gloom, their environment was ideal for the construction of elegant code.  Their machines were primitive, XT clones mostly, and their mathematical skills the best the Soviet system could produce, which is to say superb.

Thus equipped, they had managed in a very short time to produce something which has so far confounded Microsoft, IBM, and Go Corporation: a digital handwriting recognition system capable of reading cursive input.  It would, furthermore, work swiftly on any 386 clone and asciify either Roman or Cyrillic.

When they brought this to Budapest, such American slicksters as Atari's Sam Tramiel were on them like a cheap suit.  Representatives of Microsoft and other corporate Golems were only slightly less avid.  Eager to do business with all and unprotected by any sense of Western deal-making, they were ripe for the plucking.

"It's our Russian style of business to tell everybody everything," said their leader, Stepan Pachikov.  As much as I personally admired this attitude, I knew he was about to get an education in the darker side of capitalism.

Far more than socialism, a free market approximates ecology in its exchanges.  It is therefore a more fluid and robust system than the hulking machine of state planning.  But ecology, as Darwin taught us, has little of what humans would call decency in it.  Pachikov had grown up in a system in which at least the stated intentions were good, despite its utter inability to deliver on them.

At a reception in the ornate atrium of what had once been the Hungarian Supreme Court, the boys from ParaGraph were bunched tightly by surrounding predators.   Mitch observed the circling pack and drew me aside.  "I'm gonna perform a humanitarian act," he said.  "I'm gonna get those guys a lawyer."

Another concept which didn't seem to travel well was that of service for hire.  According to a number of people I talked to at the conference, it was thought that to do something for money at the bidding of an individual or private firm was a form of prostitution.  It appeared that the Marxist idea of the State as Self had actually taken, in that people remain more willing to hand their will over to a Kafkesque bureaucracy than to another human being.

Actually, the list of alien ideas was long.  It included notions about the fundamental responsibilities of organizations.  In the hall outside the conference room, there was a spirited discussion of the nature of fast-growing organizations which included Mitch, David, Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy, and Charles Simonyi (a Hungarian defector who had been one of Microsoft's principal resources since the early 80's).  This was a group which had seminal experience in the area of kudzu-like corporate blooms.  And each had plenty to say on the subject.

Joy proposed an elegant explanation for the apparently inevitable metamorphosis of cool start-ups into hideous corporations, which he called the Bozo2  Principal.  Wizards, he said, hire other Wizards.  Bozos hire Bozos.  As a company grows rapidly, it is inevitable that some Wizards will slip and hire Bozos, given the scarcity of the former and plenitude of the latter.  However, once a Bozo has been hired, he hires another, and "everything beneath them turns Bozo after that."  (This is related to Steve Jobs' famous: "A people hire A people.  B people hire C people.")

Our conversation was carefully monitored by a number of Russians, including several of the folks from ParaGraph.  One of them came up to me later and expressed wonder at the idea that hiring should be such a individually flexible process in the first place.  In the Soviet Union, he said, there were more reliable standards for such than simple human judgement.

"Do they work?" I asked. "I thought all Soviet organizations were Bozo."

"Well, yes, they are," he said, "But that doesn't mean we'll want to start building organizations by individual whim."

Ownership was another intractable tangle.  ParaGraph continues to use facilities provided by its host organism, even though the former is state property and the latter belongs, at least in part, to a real estate developer from Boulder, Colorado (their capitalist joint venture partner). At what point did the State either grant them the building or kick them out of it?

Indeed, the whole question of weaning the Eastern start-ups from the State was delicate.  As Esther put it, "For all the fascination with free markets, companies also miss the placid protected world of the past. Several that want to go private also want to keep government funding for 'research.'"

Then there were entrenched bureaucracies of the East, which, rather like their western counterparts, found much to do in the regulatory harassment of budding businesses, who were, moreover, direct competitors in this case.

In all, there were enough problems on display to try the faith of the most dedicated pronoid.

They were but minor vexations to Bill Joy, who remained a fountain of giddy prediction.  He gave a speech called World Peace Through UNIX, in which predicted, among other things, that UNIX, by the year 2000 would consist of 10-20 million lines of code, and would be the binding material of hard-wired global community.

He also said that technology firms, in order to compete, would have to be making at least $200,000 per employee, a figure which, being stated as it was in hard currency, drew an audible gasp from the Czech sitting next to me.

It was when he got into the matter of hardware performance that their mouths really got small and round.  He proposed Joy's Law, according to which MIPS (or millions of instructions per second which one machine could execute) would increase by the following formula:  MIPS = 2 Year-84. Following this logic, the standard MIPS throughput of a state-of-the art computer would be, by 1995,  211.  In other words, three years from now we will have sitting on our desks machines capable of cranking out over 4000 MIPS, many times the speed of the fastest Cray.  Gigabyte memories would be standard, he said.  He went on to talk of cubes of optically-connected mega-MIPS machines, each with more computing power than could be hacked together in the entire Soviet Union today.

For people who'd been paying automotive prices for Taiwanese clones, Joy's speech wouldn't have been any more marvelous if he had descended from the clouds in an iridescent orb to deliver it.

However showy his projections, Joy had the same agenda as many others at the conference:  Connecting Everything to Everything Else.   We were kind of like the Dalai Lama walking to a hot dog vendor and saying, "Make me one with everything." Our tools were vulgar: money, commerce, bytes zipping along on beams of light, but there was something faintly spiritual about our task nevertheless.

Among the Matrix Mystics there was Rusty Schweikart, a former Apollo astronaut and alumnus of the TM movement.  I asked him what motivated him. "I want to get things hooked up," he replied and talked about buying up abandoned Soviet military satellites and communications hardware in order to connect the civilians.

As we were talking, a boyish Russian approached me and asked my name.  When I told him, he smiled shyly and said, "I thought so.  I sent you some e-mail last week after reading about the Electronic Frontier Foundation."

This was pretty cosmic even for an old hippie like me.  The e-mail message itself had been a major score.  Of the thousands I'd gotten since co-founding EFF, his was the first from the Soviet Union. This was not surprising since, at the time it was sent, there were still only 32 telephone lines connecting the USSR with the rest of the Planet.  (It turned out he had sent it by hacking together a patch to a Finnish Internet node.)

Neither the Russian, Roustem Akhiarov, nor I had said anything in our electronic postcards which indicated an intention to come to Budapest and yet here we both were.  Encountering him made things seem pretty hooked up already.

And yet not.  Just as there were philosophical and cultural barriers impeding the development of a free market system in the East, so were there incredibly tedious and complex technical barricades between us and the realization of our good intentions.

For example, much of both the technology and the business we were discussing depended centrally on a communications infrastructure which simply does not exist.  Getting a telephone hook-up is, in much of Eastern Europe, an option available only to the extremely patient.  (Charles Simonyi's brother lives in Budapest and is affluent even by western standards.  He has been waiting for a phone for years.)

Nor does the requirement for patience end once the phone is installed. Placing a call from Budapest was like building a one-match fire in a strong wind.  And calling from Prague, despite the sleek Euro-styling of the phones in our hotel, was apparently not possible at all.

Even imagining the availability of western capital for a working information network...Sprint is reported to be considering laying fiber optics in the Soviet Union...there arose once more problems of ownership and bureaucracy.

The economic system which is emerging in the East has no difficulty granting its citizens the right to own television sets.  The ownership of a television station is far more problematic.  And there is no provision whatsoever for the ownership of a television network, either as a level of property law or organizational scale.  Communication remains a province which Eastern governments, despite their paralytic inability to deliver service, are extremely loathe to surrender.

Efforts to go around existing structures would almost certainly result in regulatory immune responses which would make the FCC look positively Libertarian.

And so forth and so on.  Everyone at the Conference was no less determined than we Fools ourselves to save the world, but close examination made many of our mutual hopes seem groundless.  Still, it may be that groundless hope, like unconditional love, is the only kind that really counts.

Groping Toward Hope

As one examines what has happened to consciousness in Eastern Europe over the last 40 years, it is hope which has taken the hardest hit.  Communism necessarily truncates aspiration.  Within its procrustean confines, ambition acquires an immoral flavor, connected as it is with individual competition and, by extension, domination of the less fit.  Whatever else about Life Among the Humans which Marx, Engels, and Lenin may have overlooked, they recognized that in any society where some are lofted by ambition, others will fall to maintain the balance.

They may have been driven by as much by an old Slavic mean-spiritedness as by Theory.  Charles Simonyi told me a joke about an angel who appears to a Russian peasant.  The angel offers to grant him anything he asks with the condition that the peasant's neighbor will receive double his request. After giving it much thought, the peasant asks the angel to blind him in one eye.

Whatever their motivations, the architects of communism endeavored to create a system in which all were similarly reduced and hope had little place.  It now appears they were quite effective at this.  One looks beneath the pleasant surface of these faces and beholds more empty country than I've seen outside of southern Wyoming.  This aridity has afflicted even the most chronically aspirational, the poets.

On two nights in a row, first in Budapest and then in Prague, I found myself up all hours exploring the spiritual barrens of two bartending poets, both of apparently significant local reputation as writers, despite their night jobs and their anomie.  (Both of these conversations were translated by different beautiful blonds named Petra, but never mind the Kosmic Koincidence of that...)

The first of these I encountered after finding in my hotel mail box a Hungarian note which, on translation, instructed me to appear in an out-of-the-way square with a newspaper under my arm at 11:30 PM.  There was no explanation or signature, but this invitation was so deliciously Le Carré-esque that I couldn't resist it.

I arrived there after the most terrifying cab ride of a career in which I have egged countless cabbies on to acts of reckless macho.  At times we were hurtling at 140 kph down unlit sidewalks atop a suspension system I wouldn't design onto a shopping cart.  The driver grinned at me and I grinned back.  At least he seemed in practice.  I wondered what other methods for  battling communist boredom might had been developed.

When, by the grace of God, we arrived, I skulked a couple of circuits around the square before being met by a Hungarian couple.  (They turned out to be friends of Morgan Russell, Mondo 2000's European correspondent.  He had asked them to show me the nocturnal sports of Budapest.)  They took me to a Spartan club which was packed with young Hungarians drinking a purple something called palinka and nodding morosely to a primo selection of American R&B songs.

I noticed the bartender's face when I entered the room.  He looked deep as the creases which swept down his angular face like tear gullies.  He had one of these long Magyar noses with the slight swell at the bridge and the elegant tip.  I watched him for a long time, pouring drinks, pursing his thin lips, chain smoking, and switching blues tapes.

After I had met the first English-speaking Petra (who was convinced she had seen me in a movie and did a little acting herself), I asked her about the bartender.  After she told me he was a poet, I asked to meet him.

He seemed surprisingly eager to talk, given his apparent diffidence about everything else.  He had never heard of Wyoming, but knew a lot about Marlboro Country.  I asked him what he thought of Americans and he told me, with doleful envy, that Americans, in his opinion, were characterized by their ability to have a good time.  "Not like us," he said in Hungarian, and then, "Not like me."

I asked him what his idea of fun was.  "Getting drunk and smoking cigarettes."  Which I could relate to, though it seemed a better beginning than end.

Then I asked him about Hungary.  The next day would be the first time an anniversary of the Hungarian Uprising could be publicly noted.  Torchlight parades were planned in both in solemn commemoration of the event itself as well as celebration of the changes which made it possible to commemorate it at all.  It would be somewhat equivalent to our July 4, 1787.  A big day. Would he carry a torch?

"No."  Why not?

He knew better than to get his hopes up.  There had been times in the past when things started to look up, but they had never come to anything.  In time, we would see that this government was no more enlightened than its predecessors.  They were only using the anniversary to manipulate public sentiment.  Everything political was much too complex to feel enthusiastic about.  He would just tend bar and write his little poems, which did no one any harm.

Watching his face as he spoke, I saw sentiments which had clouded other faces in Budapest.  Resignation, dullness, banished hope.

If they put a vise on your head for head for forty years, it will be a long time after they remove it before the pressure goes away.

The next night, in Prague, David Cole and I were wandering the beautiful rococo streets near Hadcrny Castle when we heard something which sounded like live rock music coming from a 5th storey window above us.  We entered the building (which bore no signs) and climbed the stairs to what appeared to be a kind of underground hang-out. There were political cartoons all over the walls. In an adjoining room a passing imitation of punk was being tortured over.  Despite the second-hand din, the bartender made shushing noises at us as soon as we walked in.  It was as though the place were more library than bar.

We went in and listened for several "songs."  We were even starting to like the stuff.  (Better, apparently, than the audience, who took it in with rapt but unrhythmic solemnity.)  Suddenly the lights came on and an academic sort stood up and began holding forth.  The room took on the characteristics of a lecture hall.  It was, for all we could tell, a rock 'n' roll class.

I waited until things appeared to be running down before inserting my brash American self and asking, in English, what was going on.  Although I was dismissed by the professor, the second Petra appeared at this point.  Born in Czechoslovakia, her parents had taken her to the United States after the Invasion of 1968, and she had grown up American.  After the Velvet Revolution of last December, she had returned to teach English and do everything within her power to help.

After that, it was déja vu all over again.  The bartender (again with a long, anguished-looking face) was, she told us, a fairly popular poet.  He was about to close up and we invited him over for a drink after he did so.

We had an incredibly convoluted conversation in which he said over and over that we should not extrapolate from his opinion since he was only one man and surely others would feel differently.  Feel what?  He wouldn't say, but he knew it would be different.  He seemed a furtive and beaten man, quite in contrast to the image of literary faith which Czechoslovakia's President projects.

Getting nowhere asking him what he wanted out of life, I inquired about his aspirations for his children.  He struggled with this for a long time, qualified his answer twice and finally gave it.

"I hope for them that someday they will be able to go into a shop in Prague and the shopkeepers will be polite to them."

That's it?  That was all.

One wonders how long it will take the necessary optimism of enterprise to penetrate such diminished hope that the most a poet can wish for his children is agreeable shopkeepers.





To Be At Liberty
================

An Essay for Public Television

Text by John Perry Barlow Video production by Todd Rundgren

Let me tell you where I'm coming from.  I grew up on a ranch near Pinedale, Wyoming, a very free town not far from the middle of nowhere.

It was the kind of place where a state legislator could actually say, "If the English language was good enough for our Lord Jesus Christ, it's good enough for our school children."

Though surely a hick town, it was also a real community.  There was a lot of trust.  Neither the locks nor the lawyers got used much.  People knew each other and tried let one another be.  After all, they'd come to that wild and remote place to be free.  Liberty was a fierce practice among them.  That it might also be a legal guarantee seemed irrelevant.

It seems to me that elsewhere in America liberty is far more a matter of law than practice.  The Bill of Rights is still on the books and they'd have a hell of a time putting you in jail for just saying something, but how free are we?

Whatever the guarantees, I believe liberty resides in its exercise. Liberty is really about the ability to feel free and behave accordingly. You are only as free as you act.

Free people must be willing to speak up...and listen.  They can't merely consume the fruits of freedom, they have to produce them.

This exercise of liberty requires that people trust one another and the institutions they make together. They have to feel at home in their society.

Well, Americans don't appear to trust each other much these days. Why else would we employ three times more lawyers per capita than we did in 1970?

Why else would our universities be so determined to impose tolerance that they'll expel you for saying what you think and never notice the irony?

Why else would we teach our kids to fear all strangers? Why else have we become so afraid to look one another in the eye?

We have come to regard trust as foolishness and fear as necessary.  We live in terror that the people around us might figure out what we're actually thinking.

Frankly, this America doesn't feel very free to me at all.  What has happened to our liberty?

I think much of the answer lies in the critical difference between information and experience.

These days we view most of our world through a television screen. Most of our knowledge comes from information about things, not experience with them.

Let me return to Pinedale for an example.  Those folks killed each other pretty regularly, but there wasn't much fear. They knew each other, and if somebody got shot, it wasn't too hard to figure out why.

Homicide was not abstract. It was a familiar threat, like wild horses or winter.

And you also knew that today's opponent might be the only person along to pull you out of a snowdrift tomorrow.  So tolerance and trust were practical necessities.  Living more or less safely in a world we understood, we found liberty an easy thing to keep.

But elsewhere, as I say, the average American's sense of the world has likely been derived by staring at it through the one-way tunnel of information.

What the media's taught my fellow citizens is that all the world is dangerous in some irrational, non-specific way. Terrorists are everywhere. Nature is in open rebellion. Making love can kill you. Your fellow humans are liars in suits, thugs, zealots, psychopaths, and, mostly, victims who look a lot like you.

Television amplifies the world's mayhem and gives you no way to talk back. No way to ask "Is this the way the world is?"  Just as right now it's giving you no way to argue with me.

Why does television prefer terrifying images?  Because it lives on your attention.  That's what television is really selling.  And scaring the hell out of you is, like sex, one of those really efficient ways to get your undivided focus.  To gain it, they flood your living room with images designed to hit your fear glands like electricity.

So we have erected a glowing altar in the center of our lives that feeds on our terror, and Fear has become our national religion.

We ask the government to defend us against the virtual goblins that stream from the tube, and the government has obliged us.

For example, in 1992, a total of two Americans died in terrorist attacks. Not what I'd call a major threat. But our fear of them is so real that we spend tens of billions a year to protect ourselves from terrorism. For many Americans, making the car payments depends on keeping this fear alive.

But you cannot build a society of general trust in an atmosphere of general fear. The fearful are never free.

If we are to fight back - if we are to regain the courage necessary to the practice of liberty - we are going to have to stage another kind of revolution.  We need to find a new means of understanding the world that takes no profit from our fear.

We need a medium that, like life itself, allows us to probe it for the truth. We need, in essence, to cut out the middlemen and speak directly to one another.  Indeed, we need a place where we can share information unfiltered by the needs and desires of either Big Brother or the Marketing Department down at Channel Six.

Such a medium may be spreading across the planet in a thickening web of connected computers called the "Internet."  Through the Internet I can already get a personal connection with people all over the globe, learning from those on the scene what's really going on.  Through the Internet I can publish my own understandings to whomever might be interested, in whatever numbers.

During the War in the Persian Gulf, I was able to get minute by minute reports from the laptop computers of soldiers in the field.  The picture they presented felt far more detailed, more troubling and ambiguous, than the mass hallucination presented on CNN.

The Internet is also creating a new place...many call it Cyberspace...where new communities like Pinedale can form. The big difference will be that these Cyberspace communities will be possible among people whose bodies are located in many different places in the world.

Direct communication should breed understanding and tolerance.  Our fears will be far easier to check out.  We may begin to understand that these distant and sometimes alien creatures are real people whose rights are directly connected to our own.

I imagine the gathering places of Cyberspace, some as intimate as Pinedale's Wrangler Cafe, some more vast than Tienanmen Square.  I imagine us meeting there in conditions of trust and liberty that no government will be able to deny.

I imagine a world, quite soon to come, in which ideas can spread like fire, as Jefferson said, "expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe... incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation by anyone."

If ideas can spread like fire, then freedom, like water, will flow around or over those that stand in its way.  In Cyberspace, I hope that truth will be self-evident.





Verbum Magazine Interview

Originally published in [Verbum Magazine Issue 5.2 - Virtual Reality](https://archive.org/details/verbum.5.2.fall.winter.1991 "Verbum Magazine Issue 5.2")

John Barlow, interviewed by Michael Gosney

John Barlow is one of the most appreciated individuals on the new media scene. Perhaps it's his affable personality\* or his cogent way with words. John views the world from the dual perspective of a down-to-earth rancher and a longtime lyricist for the Grateful Dead. He has recently found himself playing a leadership role on the forward edge of digital media. He cofounded the Electronic Frontier Foundation with Lotus founder Hitch Kapor\* has been hyperactive on the "cyberculture" lecture circuit, and is writing a book about it all titled Everything We Know Is Wrong to be published in 1992 by Viking Penguin. Verbum's Michael Gosney interviewed him during the SiCGRAPH conference in Las Vegas In August 1991.

JOHN PERRY BARLOW

MG: In the last couple of years you've been finding yourself in a cultural observer/commentator position with the new computer-culture scene. Might you describe that?

JB: Well you know, this is where the interesting people are. It used to be that you hung around rock 'n' roll because that was where the interesting people were, but I don't think of the standard arts, either music or the quiet arts, as having anything like the creative juice at the moment that I see in the interesting hybrid that's developed between the computer and artists. Its kind of like cross-breeding animals of very different genetic material; the hybrid is a good deal stronger than either of its progenitors. That's what I see here. There's an enormous amount of energy and creative vigor bringing an amazingly expanded sense of the possible. Expanded almost beyond the ability of people to easily incorporate it. I think the most interesting thing that is going on is the gradual recognition on the part of a lot of people that these things are not simply a medium, but a place. A place where we're already spending a majority of our time without even noticing it.

MG: The cyberspace place?

JB: Yeah, exactly.

MG: As I've heard you define it, "Where your money is right now."

JB: You look at the way people lead their lives now and more and more their lives are based on information rather than experience. The input is not hands on. It comes to you from one screen or another. And I have a lot of concerns about that, but I think it's a very interesting phenomenon, and it bears closer watching than anything else that I can think of going on culturally. The other thing about it is that the whole field is sufficiently malleable that I can come in with no experience except 17 years running a cattle ranch and a reasonably acute pair of eyes and actually have an effect on the future in the sense of helping people define the proper metaphors and define the work they do around those metaphors. That's very satisfying.

MG: Certainly your highest-profile tangible activity, other than being a lyricist for the Grateful Dead and a co-speaker with Timothy Leary, seems to be your relationship with Mitch Kapor and your activity with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Could you give us a brief description and update on that?

JB: As I say, I think computers are creating a place and it's a place that is fundamentally different from any place that we have ever lived before. And we're moving there without proper thought to the kind of society that we want to build there and no sense of the social contract that's going to apply.

A social contract requires billions of individual human interactions to develop ... and a lot of time. Mitch and I felt that the conditions under which cyberspace is settled have to be kept open and fluid in order for that process to proceed correctly. To that end, we founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The first order of business is to assess the nature of cyberspace. It seems to us that conditions there are completely different. We don't know some very basic things, like what's property and how do you define it and how do you restrict its passage. Because property in this context is different from any kind of property that we're really used to dealing with. For example, copyright and patent only appear to work as well as they do because they're fundamentally vested in physical objects. Copyright worked because it was hard to make a book; as soon as it quit being hard to make a book, it quit working. By the same token, patent works as long as you're doing a transformation of material into an object and executing on a physical plane. When that's gone, then it's a whole new ball game.

We don't have answers to that, we don't know about issues of privacy. Your every commercial move is now recorded. We're either going to give up privacy altogether or we're going to have to come up with some different methods for achieving it. I'm not very comfortable with the idea of government regulation of personal information because I don't want the government regulating any kind of information.

But, there is such a range of issues attached to this. I mean, we originally just thought that what we were going to do was to make certain that everybody understood that the First Amendment applies to digital media, and among our earliest realizations was that the First Amendment is a local ordinance, really. Cyberspace has no national boundaries and the level of personal liberty will tend to fall to the lowest common denominator, which is often corporate rather than governmental. There's no First Amendment in any corporation. One of the things you do when you sign up to work for a large corporation is give up freedom of speech. Seriously.

And so, with all these issues for EFF to deal with, it's a little like you've got a thread hanging out on your sweater — you grab it to pull it out and the next thing you know you've got more yarn on the floor than there was in the sweater and the sweater's still there. We find ourselves dealing with telecommunications policy, with private property law, with civil liberties and a whole range of issues that are extremely complex.

MG: Is the Electronic Frontier Foundation funded by any of the high-tech companies?

JB: Until recently, as you know, we were funded exclusively by Mitch Kapor and Steve Wozniak and John Gilmore. We all felt the instabilities in that system of funding. Over the long term it's not a good way to do it, and it's not fair to ask those guys to pay for things that are in everybody's interest, so we recently started going around to large companies and saying, "Look, there's a necessary nexus between free speech and free enterprise, especially when the item of commerce looks so much like speech that they're practically indistinguishable. You have an economic interest in seeing to it that law develops in a way that will make it possible for you to have an open market in the future."

And they've been pretty responsive to that. We're just now starting to get major corporate support: Sun just gave us $75,000 in workstations. We just had a meeting in Silicon Valley with CEOs from a lot of different companies, and I think we're going to be looking at significant support.

MG: Great. What would be the priorities in terms of activities?

JB: Well, we want to try to define projects they can put money into and also feel comfortable with. I mean, a lot of them are very uneasy about getting into bed with civil libertarians. Unfortunately, we've reached a point in this great land of the free where an affection for liberty bears a certain taint, weirdly enough. So we're putting together projects dealing with telecommunications policies, for example. This is an area where they all have a vested interest and they don't have a sufficient understanding of the regulatory nightmare to try to untangle it themselves. So they're increasingly turning to us to do that.

MG: I see. Are there any government agencies that parallel your activities or that you're relating to?

JB: No. It feels to us like we rushed into an enormous vacuum. That's part of the problem: the vacuum turned out to be so huge that practically any energy we pour into it is a drop in the bucket in comparison to what needs to be done. But so far we're basically the only people in there.

Actually, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility has been there for a while but they're more focused on Star Wars and privacy issues. And they also have a different take on the whole issue of privacy than I do. I mean, they're more comfortable with the idea of trying to regulate personal information. MC: The whole issue of copyright with regard to all this self-publishing and self-production is certainly something hard to deal with.

JB: I just think we're going to have to give up on it. But I think there are still methods to get paid for the work you do with your mind, because ideas are not static. Right now we've got this enormous glut of data which is putting all of society into datashock. But the difference between information and data is a distinction that can only be drawn by the operation of the human mind, applying meaning to the data. There's always going to be a market for people who can stripmine the data and find the ore. And they're going to get paid for the delivery of their opinion in a lot of different fashions, if not necessarily by royalty as it's been in the past.

I think in a lot of cases what you're going to have is writings that get disseminated very broadly but with a premium placed on being the first person to get the information. So it's going to be a matter of where you are in time, rather than a matter of possession. And I don't think we're going to leave the tangible world altogether by any means, because people still like books and they're going to go on liking books. And as long as you're still converting information into something tangible, you've got a point where you can protect it.

MG: What do you think about the whole concept of multimedia?

JB: I'm starting to refer to it as mucho-media, because there sure is a lot of it. You know it's funny: I went to this multimedia roundtable at UCLA and there were assembled the graybeards of multimedia — Negroponte and Sculley and all these wise men gathered together — and it was like there was a giant invisible elephant in the room. I mean they could just smell it. They just knew it was there, but nobody could describe it. Nobody knew how to make a buck from it. And I think that's likely to be the case for awhile. What I think multimedia will be good for is postsymbolic communication between people. Not so much as a publication medium but more like video mail. I think people are going to try to convey their experiences to one another in a form that is more closely parallel to the sense of experience than language is. So I really see multimedia more as a communications form than as a broadcast form.

MG: VideoDesk, Nyron Krueger's thing, is kind of neat. Sharing space with another person, interacting with another person in virtual space.

JB: Right, exactly. But there's a problem there. I went to Xerox Pare and I met this fellow who'd been running their video room project — they had a room in Xerox Pare and they had another one at their research facility in Portland — and these two rooms were totally wired: I mean if you were in one, in a sense you were in the other. You could see everybody who was in both rooms if you were in one. You could hear what they were saying, you could see their body language, you could interact with them. And I asked him, "Well, do you feel that it works?" And he said, "No." And I said, "Why not? What's missing?" And he said "The pranja" The breath.

MG: I think that's a very essential point. Except the extent to which human beings can know each other better through this enhanced communication, and thereby subtler levels of communication can be facilitated.

JB: Right.

MG: You talk to someone on the phone and you can get pretty darn far in knowing a personality.

JB: The phone is a broad band width communications medium. The phone has some real advantages over text.

MG: It has feeling In it.

JB: It has feeling in it, exactly. It can contain a kind of nuance that text rarely delivers. You don't need to tell people on the phone that you're joking. In E-mail, if you don't put a smiley face on there you're in jeopardy of being taken far too seriously.

MG: In general, we seem to be waiting to see what multimedia can be\*

JB: Right now, we know what multimedia is. And there's nothing very complicated about it: Multimedia is simply the ability to put pictures and sound into the datastream. And that's all. And we've been able to do that in a lot of different ways for a long time.

MG: But we can interact and edit In ways we never could.

JB: That's right. I think that we're quite a ways off from knowing what this is in the sense of what it will become. Right now I'm perfectly content to see people build tools like crazy if they can figure out a market for them and then let the street find its own uses, as Bill Gibson says. I have a sense that all of this stuff, going back to the cave paintings, is about some Great Work that human beings have been about for a long time. My sense is that we are trying to create Collective Consciousness. Hard-wiring the human Mind, with a capital M. And I have sort of a hippie-mystic vision of that, but every vector I can plot from so many different areas and fields is headed that direction and at a hell of a rate. And I don't know what that's going to be like, that collective organism.

MG: Well in this broad sense, it seems like multimedia is an area that promises to help us get the Big Picture. What are we? Who are we? Assimilate and transmit the picture back to the human organism.

JB: There's some real danger associated with it. Some of the stuff we've done so far, along the line of television, has actually not taken us closer to reality, if there is such a thing, but further away from it. It describes the map and not the territory. If you had any doubt about that, you weren't paying close attention during the war in the Gulf. You had the screen reality that was highly mediated. Where the whole thing was clean, surgical, no problem. And then you had those poor bastards down on the ground who were still another century.

MG: Do you have any thoughts on the artists and their roles and responsibilities in the development of these new media forms?

JB: I think the artist's role is as it has always been which is to explore perception. Coming to deeper understanding of how it is that we go about making the complex thing we call reality. Dramatically enhanced tools are becoming available to pursue that. I think the best thing about virtual reality is that it's the first time we've had a mechanism for studying how reality gets created in the first place. We thought we knew what intelligence was until we set out to make some. And now we don't know very much about making artificial intelligence, but we do know a hell of a lot more about intelligence. I think virtual reality is going to deliver to a lot of people the realization that reality is an opinion and not a fact. And that's a helpful realization, I think. MC: I'm hoping multimedia can strike back at the numbing literalism that the canned media is forcing on us\*

JB: Well it's going to go both ways. It's going to make matters worse and better.

MG: The point that it gets to is, what do we do with multimedia?

JB: If you look at it as a medium from the many to the many, if you look at it as a telephone and not a television, which is how I prefer to look at it, then you don't have the imposed spewing of market insensitivity. A hell of a lot of what's wrong with TV is terror of offending anybody out there in this vast market. If you know who your audience is, you know if you're going to offend them or not. So I think in that sense, many-to-many multimedia has the capacity to carry the unvarnished truth a lot more effectively than something that is pitched at 20 million. It's something that costs a hell of a lot to produce. If it's really expensive, chances are it's not likely to be as truthful as if it's sort of loincloth and machete.

MG: Back to the culture, the people who are creating these tools, this melding of artists and software engineers and so forth, do you see any parallels with the kind of rock V roll culture of the sixties?

JB: Oh sure. I don't want to make too much of that parallel because I think that there's something debilitating about a certain kind of sixties nostalgia. It's sort of the re-creation of that golden glittering era, often leaving out a number of side effects that were pretty appalling — then and later. I mean, this is now and that was then. And what's going on now is as interesting to me in a lot of different ways than what went on then. I think what's going on now is subtler, doesn't have the same kind of mass cultural quality; it's much more splintered and individualistic and segmented, and that's okay. There's something inevitably dangerous about mass movements of any sort.

MG: Multimedia and virtual reality technology have started to take on a pop culture kind of dimension\*

JB: Oh, yeah. I just recently became aware that what I was looking at was a movement. People are going to look back and talk about cyberpunks in the same way they talk about hippies and beatniks.

MG: So it's really a social movement that people are going to start relating to?

JB: They're relating to it now. They're developing a style and an aesthetic, actually less in the United States than in Japan, Europe and England. We're sort of behind the curve on this one, which is curious because this is where the stuff that it's based on is getting done.

MG: We're also leading the curve.

JB: The mass cultural movement among younger kids is taking place elsewhere, but the tools that they're picking up on are being made here.

MG: Yeah, it's fascinating in that respect. The U.S. culture in general is kind of boring these days.

JB: Well, I don't know how boring it is, but I think the people in general are in datashock. They've been so bludgeoned with this continual hosing-down of information that they don't have any way of incorporating it into their lives. Their lives are confusing and alienating. A lot of people are just sort of hunkered down to the extent that they can be. Personally, I like ambiguity. I like confusion — I look at it as an opportunity. But most folks look at it as a threat. I once had a dream in which Sigmund Freud told me that neurosis was the inability to tolerate ambiguity, and that's actually a pretty good definition. And there's a hell of a lot of that form of neurosis out there, believe me, and it's getting worse. I see a tendency in this country for people to rise up and call for shorter chains and smaller cages. And the trouble is that this is enough of a democracy that they're going to get what they want.

MG: Do you have any final thoughts for us?

JB: No, I just think we live in interesting times.

MG: Like it or not.

JB: Like it or not, and the difference between it's being a blessing or a curse is whether or not you've got sufficient confidence in yourself to surf it. It's like being in heavy white water: If you try to control the situation, you're in big trouble but if you try to interact with it, you're going to be all right.





Who Holds The Keys?
===================

WHO HOLDS THE KEYS? Friday, March 20, 1992

Chair: Dorothy Denning, Georgetown University

Panel:  Jim Bidzos, RSA Data Security David Bellin, Pratt Institute John Gilmore, Cygnus Support \[Now also with EFF\] Whitfield Diffie, SunSoft, Inc. John Perry Barlow, Electronic Frontier Foundation

D. DENNING: Welcome to the session on "Who Holds the Keys?"And in case you hadn't decrypted that by looking at the program, the session is actually about cryptography and some of the implications of cryptography in terms of personal privacy, electronic communications, and so on.  Behind all the issues is to what extent should the government actually have control over the technology and our use of the technology and so forth.

We have five panelists with us today, so I'm going to keep my comments extremely short because I want to give them the opportunity to speak about the issues, and then I want to have time for the audience to ask questions.  But what I would like to do, for those who might have missed the announcement that was in the first CFP Progress newsletter that came out: the Computer Systems Privacy and Advisory Board has voted -- made a recommendation by unanimous agreement -- that there should be a public discussion and evaluation of the cryptography policy for the country.  This recommendation was just made, I believe, two days ago, so we don't yet know what the response of the administration will be to it.  But I find that extremely encouraging and hopeful.

Our first panelist today is David Bellin, who's on the faculty of the Pratt Institute.

BELLIN: 3FA0 FF48 0ADD 3C. (laughter) Thank you very much.  I guess I could just sit down now, knowing that I think there was only one person in this room who understood what I said thus far.  One question I want to pose to you is, Does that mean that I should be prohibited from getting up here and uttering what seems to you to be nonsense? And let me point out that my algorith. m to develop the words I just said is quite unique -- it's at least as hard to decrypt as DES, or as easy, depending on your belief in trapdoors.  Does this mean I should be restricted in my ability to sell the algorithm to others? Or that I should be forced to furnish the algorithm or the internals of it to a government agency? Or that my use or sale of this encryption algorithm should be permitted only with governmental leave? Should commercial carriers that distribute my words be permitted, or even required, to restrict distribution of my speech if it's presented in a form they cannot understand? Or even more dangerous, of course, if it's presented in a form that some hypothetical government agency can't understand? Well, in my view, all of these proposals, which you've heard in other forms before, are nonsensical.  I think that the freedom of speech described in our Bill of Rights gives me the freedom to encrypt my speech in any manner I desire.  Of course, that freedom of speech is not absolute.  You can't shout "Fire!"in a crowded theater, but of course, you can't accuse me of shouting "Fire!" if you can't understand what I'm saying. Encrypted speech is clearly protected behavior, in this sense.  Well, we have a cherished concept in this right to speak our minds freely, and of course, sometimes we want people to understand us.

A closely-associated concept is the right to freely associate with our peers in order to engage in other protected legal activities, such as that of speech people can understand without a key.  But privately-encoded means of communication are crucial to the ability to associate freely with our peers in this day and age.  How could we associate freely if a real, well-founded fear exists that somebody will be listening as we attempt to get together? Aside from a few persons who do exist who have personality deviations of interest to psychiatrists, few of us would choose to engage, for example, in some of our bedroom activities if we knew.

that a government agency or snoopy neighbor could look in on us.  But extend that thought to other spheres of life. Imagine how much harder it would be to organize a local PTA to rally against the policies of the local principal if the school principal was the spouse of a Senor Ortega who Bruce Sterling described yesterday.

The proposals of the Bush administration and law enforcement agencies are constantly in the direction of opening up that metaphorical bedroom door so that they can look in.  And of course there are bad guys out there, as they remind us, rapists, terrorists, international subversives, and lately, of course, it's the drug cartels that are the big ones.  They all have more money than law enforcement; they're all more flexible and cunning than law enforcement -- perhaps they're smarter, also, I don't know.  The argument goes that we need restrictive cryptography policies in order to keep advanced technology out of the hands of these bad guys.  Well, as far as I'm concerned, this is really just more nonsense.

The restriction on high-tech exports prevents the Soviet Union from developing an advanced space program, or from developing advanced radar systems, or from developing advanced missile guidance systems.  Presently, it's illegal to export a 300-baud modem to certain countries.  Do you really believe that the technology is so controllable that those countries cannot now transmit data at 300-baud? Clearly, this begins to enter a realm of ideology, and not reality.  As far as I can see, criminals or foreign entities will get advanced encryption technologies no matter what our government does.  You can't control free trade in scientific information.  The mathematical theory upon which cryptographic techniques are based is openly available.  If the government was to attempt to restrict that type of information, it would clearly turn into a trampling of our democratic principles.

I also don't accept an adage that I've heard repeated over and over at. this conference -- that there's a continuum, and at one end there's public safety and at the other end there's freedom.  We should think about the social conditioning served by establishing these two as polar opposites, which I don't think they are.  Just what are the scales of justice balancing along this continuum? For example, when we speak about public safety, we should give a little bit of thought to whom we pretend to keep safe, and from whom or what we seek to keep them protected.  For example, keeping Bankamerica safe from fraud is a lot different than keeping me safe when I go out in my back yard and fall into my swimming pool.  Will cryptographic controls really keep me safe from a robbery on my way home tonight?  And what if the safety I want is the safety from surveillance, from others seeing what I do in what I consider my private time? And by the way, again, whom am I being kept safe from? The drug cartels?  The Communists? Or political opponents of the current administration?

On the other side is supposed to be freedom.  We love to toss the word freedom around, and we love to hear how the enslaved and oppressed everywhere else in the world want the freedom we have.  It might be useful in a conference like this to give a little consideration to what our freedoms really consist of.  Is it the freedom to go to our hypothetical supermarket and buy the hypothetical brand of coffee at a discount? The freedom to have cheap petroleum products? The freedom to go to the mall and listen to Muzak? Well, if those are the freedoms, then maybe this continuum put forth makes some sense.  But to me, a consumption-based concept of freedom has little appeal.  The freedoms I seek to preserve are the freedom to speak my mind on issues that concern me, the freedom to associate freely with other citizens to exercise some control over government policy and elected officials, and the freedom to insist that government act to promote the general social welfare.  Those are the. freedoms I seek to preserve and extend, and in that sense, this safety- freedom continuum seems to make no sense to me.

I was reminded of another analogy often made yesterday when I talked to my old friend Richard Civille, who I met when I was on the board of CPSR.  He reminded me of the old adage that when guns are outlawed, that only outlaws will have them. That analogy is clear here, but thinking about that phrase forced me to think about the other analogy which is often made about the new electronic frontier and how those of us inhabiting it now are cowboys on the new frontier.  I reflected upon this, and I think really that that's a fundamentally flawed concept.  Remember when Columbus got here -- I'm sorry, I may hear about this later -- but remember when Columbus got here, it wasn't really an empty frontier.  Of course, there were some people around.  And who were the cowboys? Well, to some, they were an extension of Columbus' arrival on the non-empty frontier where there were people living, yes, called native Americans.  And in terms of looking at our own cultural history, it might be more interesting to look at things through the eyes of the native Americans, of the Indians out there on the frontier.  Of course, the metaphor used about a virgin frontier is also very loaded with machismo and other nuances that I will leave aside for the moment.  Look at it from the Indians' point of view.  The railroads were coming through, and with them the cowboys and the cavalry weren't far behind.

Well, I would allege in our sphere of computers and telecommunications, the railroad's coming through now also. I would argue that cryptographic techniques should be encouraged, widely disseminated, and that all networks should be forced to include encryption of mail as a default standard available to all users. (applause) Thanks.  It's only in this way that we'll be left free to say what we want, to associate with whom we want, and to keep from being forced onto little piec. es of land from which nobody will be able to hear us anyway.  Thank you. (applause)

D. DENNING: Our next panelist will be Jim Bidzos, who's the president of RSA Data Security.

BIDZOS: Thank you, Dorothy.  The next eight to ten minutes, I'm going to try to give everyone here a little perspective and lesson in cryptography and explain everything.  Actually, what I would like to do is try to put this digital telephony issue in a little bit of perspective and talk more about the historical policies of the U.S. government towards cryptography.  I think maybe it will give us an idea of where we might want to try to go to make some real progress here because there are certainly some problems.

First of all, there are three ways that I've observed that the US Government manifests its policy in cryptography.  The first is in export control; the second is in standards; and a third is in legislative and executive action.  For example, the creation of the National Security Agency in 1952 effectively set the cryptographic policy in the United States for at least the next 25 years.  The proposal of a digital signature standard by the Commerce Department very recently is an example of an approach to policy through standards. And, of course, the export controls that exist routing cryptographic systems through the State Department are also an example of that policy.

There's something that's very interesting about all this.  We can certainly lump the digital telephony issue, and also last year's S.266 -- the proposal to essentially outlaw the use of cryptography that the government couldn't access -- into this category as well.  But what's really interesting about all these policies, if you think about them, is that they all put the government in an adversarial role with industry.  Instead of industry and government working together, we essentially find ourselves fighting all of the time, whether it's over legislation -- which a lot of us here are obviously very interested in --. whether it's over standards that many of us may not agree with, whether it's over an export policy that many of us continue to fight.  It's an ongoing battle that's going on today and has been for a long time.  The long-term effects of that adversarial relationship, I think, are much worse than some of things we're seeing now.  It's pretty clear that many of these things aren't thought out, they aren't done in consultation with industry.  They're usually done in private and they're essentially forced on us.  They tend to look like knee-jerk reactions in many cases.  I think S.266 is a good example of that.  I think this digital telephony proposal is a good example of that.  So there's a lot of turmoil and confusion, and I think danger as well.  We really have to be careful here.  I think that a lot of these proposals are not well thought out, primarily because they're not done in consultation with industry, they're basically done in back rooms.  For example, one could argue right now that economic policy is being made by the intelligence agencies.  I personally don't think that's a particularly good idea.

Now, why is all of this happening? There are all the obvious reasons -- there's more networking, there are more people concerned about their privacy, the world's moving more and more into the electronic frontier, as we've heard.  But there are other things that are changing as well.  Cryptography is moving into mainstream products; cryptographic technology is out, it's available.  These things aren't going to change. The companies that produce the mainstream products and want to use cryptography are going to continue to do so -- they're going to want to do more of it.  We've seen that now in many cases, especially in the area of export laws and some of the battles that are going on right now.  Also, a lot of the companies that are building these systems today aren't the traditional kind of company that had a special kind of relationship with the government, in pa. rticular, many of the agencies that made these policies.  For example, I don't thing that Microsoft or Apple are companies that are greatly influenced by the Defense Department.  They don't derive much of their revenue from them, they aren't influenced by them, so we are seeing more and more of this turmoil.  This helps explain a lot of why this is happening, and also the emergence of electronic commerce, which is rapidly becoming global.

I think this is also driving a lot of these clashes between government and industry and causing sparks in the area of cryptographic policy.  I think there's room on both sides here for a little more understanding.  For example, I think it's very wrong for the Justice Department to believe that it can slip some language into different bills and perhaps keep trying until that works.  I think there are too many people, many of them in this room, who understand these techniques, who are prepared to fight them and bring attention to them. I don't think that's ever going to succeed.  They're very vague and nonspecific which makes them very, very dangerous. So I don't think that approach is going to work at all. However, they also have some legitimate interests, which I think we need to be more sensitive to.

Now one of the interesting things here that I think many of these proposals fail to recognize is that we technically have a large number of options.  We can do a lot of different things.  Let me, for example, just describe very briefly one technical approach to possibly addressing some of the concerns of the Justice Department.  This is just a relatively simple proposal, but an interesting one to think about, primarily due to Ron Rivest.  And that is simply that in a world where public key cryptography may be used extensively, there may be these things called certificates, which are essentially a trusted copy of one's public key.  A simple way to protect the interest of both parties in this case --  and again, this is just a proposa. l and to get people to thinking and understanding that there are many, many different options -- is that one's public key could also in fact be signed by some independent party.  Now let's say, for the sake of argument, that this might be your bank.  What that signature on your public key or on your standard certificate from your bank may say is that the owner of the corresponding private key has in fact registered or escrowed that private key with this organization, and presented with the proper documents, whether it is a warrant or whatever it may be, then that private key could be made available.  This is just a simple example of how technology could be applied to provide far less control than a piece of legislation that says anything you do that interferes with what I want to do is illegal and I can fine you money and send you to jail.

When we begin to understand that we have all these different options, then I think the important thing is to realize that we need to have a national policy review.  And I in particular welcome the decision action recommendations of the advisory board to Congress formed by the Computer Security Act to have a national policy review in this field.  I think it's the single most important thing we can do.  First of all, the advisory board, again, advises the Congressional committees who have oversight over the Computer Security Act. I think it's one of our best channels into Congress to actually effect some sort of a positive change.  I think it's important that government stop fighting with industry and that they finally start working together in this area because ultimately we're going to go nowhere.  It's pretty clear that our economic interests are some of the most important interests that we have today, and the more government and industry fight on this, the less progress we're going to make.  I think it's true that traditionally whenever interests dominated by military concerns have controlled certain technologies, then they've . ultimately been released. We found that by the time that tends to happen, the markets have been captured by companies from other countries.  I hate to see that happen in this field, so in addition to all the personal privacy issues, we also have a national competitiveness issue.  I would encourage everyone to support the recommendations of the advisory board to have a national review on cryptographic policy.  I think it's long overdue and it's high time that we did it so we can stop this kind of thrashing conflict between government and industry and start working toward some rational policy that will work for all of us.  Thank you.  (applause)

DENNING: Next is John Gilmore from Cygnus Support.

GILMORE: Hello.  I'm going to keep my talk fairly short this time.  I'm giving up some time to let Whit Diffie expand his presentation.

What I'd like to talk about is the need for discussions on cryptography to happen in the public.  The NSA has a long history of working these things out in private, using a sort of divide and conquer approach, making regulations that you only find out about when you go and talk to them.  You can't just look them up, you can't design your product based on what you know about them.  Instead, when you go to get export permission you find out that you have to rewrite your product.  There's a strong presumption in our law against something called secret law.  I think it was Justice Brandeis, in the process of knocking down some such regulation, who said that secret law is an abomination.

The pro-cryptography use side has been trying to pull this stuff out into the public, into the public eye, and into public debate.  One such example is an amendment to the Export Administration Act that has been pushed, in particular by Microsoft, that would transfer control for export of cryptography in mass market software products to the Commerce Department.  Moving from the State Department to the Commerce Department may not sound like much -- it's still . the government running it -- but it turns out that the State Department on this issue is basically run by NSA, and the Commerce Department is much more aligned with reality. (laughter and applause)  So this has been successfully put into the bills, in both House and Senate, and of course the bills were slightly different, so they've gone to a conference committee.  The administration has threatened to veto the bill over three items in it.  One of them was this transfer of encryption, so Senator Jake Garn went to the NSA and said, we need to negotiate this out.

It turns out that what has been happening is that the NSA picked the Software Publishers Association and has been negotiating with them over this, without going through a public process and without dealing with the concerns of any other part of the industry.  Now, I think there's a lot of danger in this.  One of the dangers is that what we'll get is something that meets the interests of these companies, but not the interests of their users.  Another danger is that particular threats to civil liberties in general are not addressed in this.  Another one is that because these negotiations are happening in secret and by people who aren't used to negotiating with the NSA, there's an opportunity for the NSA to sort of pull the wool over their eyes, to say, no, this is how it has to be, we can't let you get encryption any stronger than this, and that's just the way it is.  People who maybe have been dealing with the NSA and the issue longer can go in there and say, this is ridiculous and you know it's ridiculous -- DES is all over the world, and not allowing DES would just be stupid.  In addition, there's a potential to produce a sort of government-sanctioned monopoly through which algorithms will be exportable that would benefit particular companies without that choice ever really seeing the light of day in a public process.

I think that the right way to approach this is to open up this negotiation process, open u. p the secret draft agreements that are going back and forth between these people.  Bring in the civil liberties people, bring in the computer manufacturers, the network software companies, all the people who are concerned about this besides mass market software publishers.  I think this is a really good year for working on export issues.  I think there has been a lot of progress with COCOM; there's been a lot of progress with proposals to cut the military budget, to shrink the black budget, and to stop pretending that we're in a cold war.  I don't think we should let this chance pass.  I think we should work pretty hard either to keep this amendment that gives full authority to Congress to switch it to the Commerce Department, or we should open up the give and take between the public and NSA to public negotiation.  Thank you.  (applause)

D. DENNING: Next is John Perry Barlow.

BARLOW: John was also liberal with his time on my behalf.  He and I have been working together on an article for Communications of the ACM, which I'm going to try to compress in real time, since it's far too long to fit here, but essentially I want to back up to last year's conference.  I came away from that conference troubled by a widespread willingness I felt I discerned for many people to trust the government with the regulation of privacy.  Everybody understood that Cyberspace is a very public kind of place -- every time you make an economic move, you smear your fingerprints all over it, and a lot of folks were ready to take the sort of European approach in having the government regulating private information.  I'm not comfortable with that at all.

The solution to many of these problems obviously involves encryption.  Well, there are problems now, as we see, with encryption.  I mean, one of the areas where I've expanded my sense of the frontier analogy is that when we first came to Cyberspace, I didn't recognize that it was already fully occupied by a well-established army of occupati. on which had been there a long time in the form of the National Security Administration (sic).  And this group of 40,000 troops has got this place wired for sound.  I mean, there is very little that goes on in Cyberspace that doesn't go through the big sieve out here at Fort Meade.  And they want to be able to have that sieve continue to work.

Now there is some ambiguity about who the enemy might be at the moment. (laughter)  That doesn't seem to trouble them.  I got particularly rattled about it when I realized that not only could we not dust off our hands in satisfaction, having killed Senate Bill 266 and its provisions to give every cop in America the doorkey to our locks, but we had essentially sown the dragon's teeth, because 266 is coming up in many different forms in many different places.  The most discouraging of these to me is a series of meetings that have been taking place on digital cellular standards -- the TR.45 standard-setting committee which has adopted a standard that was basically mandated by the NSA, which will not be published, which is unusual with an encrypted standard. Usually you publish it so that people can try to break it.  A lot of people in the cryptology community say that it is not going to be published because it's very easily breakable.  In fact, one person -- and I wish this were not a unnamed source because I'd love to be able to say who this is -- but one fellow told me that because of the laxity of the standard, it would be possible for any county sheriff in America to attach a black box to his PC and get the plain text of your cellular phone conversation.  Well, you don't need a law when you've done that.  If you're really think that ECPA is going to apply, and you don't have to worry about it on those grounds, then you have to wonder why law enforcement is so worried about encryption in the first place, and whether it's going to take away from them something that they already have.

But the real problem, I think, is that we . are using an instrument of foreign policy, supposedly, and foreign jurisdiction, to set the domestic agenda.  There is a cultural conspiracy which doesn't involve maligned gray people meeting in dark rooms.  It's simply a cultural coincidence of belief between the law enforcement community and the NSA.  In fact, when I started trying to find out if there was any kind of direct collusion between the NSA and the FBI on encryption, what I found -- and I talked to people like Stansfield Turner and Bobby Ray Inman -- I found people at very high levels who would immediately, when you started asking them about export of encryption, would immediately go to the war on some drugs.  Right away.  And this is supposedly a domestic matter.  What we are doing in essence is conducting domestic policy with the NSA.  I don't believe this is correct; I think the proposals that are being called for here to limit the NSA, to open up the whole standard setting for encryption in the United States are very timely, and we must do this now.  Thank you. (applause)

D. DENNING: And finally, our last panelist is Whit Diffie, and we've agreed to let Whit have thirteen minutes instead of ten, in exchange for which he's going to entertain us with slides.

DIFFIE: OK.  I gave this talk at one hour's length to the Committee on Communications and Information Policy of the IEEE on Tuesday.  Lance heard it and said, "I think Computers, Privacy, and Freedom ought to hear these remarks,"so here you have the fourth time -- this is the speed version.

Insert Fig. 10-1 & caption "Figure 10-1"

I think if you think about it, you'll realize that the most important things any of you ever do by way of security have nothing to do with the guards, the fences, the badges, the safes, or any of that stuff (Figure 10-1).  That far and away the most important security measure in anybody's life is that you recognize the people you know, you recognize the people you work with.  And you have a mechanism for extending . that recognition by introduction, so you come to know, come to trust people you didn't know before because people you did know introduced them to you.  Then you have a transferable form of authentication that you use constantly.  You have your written signature and you put your signature on something and the recipient can show it to a third party and say, "Here.  Look.  Whit Diffie promised to do that.  See his signature on this letter."  And then finally, you have the possibility of closing your door, stepping aside somewhere, and having a private conversation with somebody.

Insert Fig. 10-2 & caption "Figure 10-2"

Well, the question for us comes down to, What do you do when you move from a world of pen and ink and face-to-face conversations into a world of electronic mail, telephone, video conferences, and electronic data interchange (Figure 10-2)?  And make no mistake about it, before the end of this decade, two-person video conference, which for reasons of cost, has not really appeared yet, is just going to sweep this country the way fax has, the way PCs have.  It'll make possible collaborative work over a distance, and it will transform every corporation's and every social group's way of operating.

Insert Fig. 10-3 & caption "Figure 10-3"

We are awash in technologies that decrease privacy -- lots of them developed under the umbrella of the war against terrorism, the war against drugs, a lot of them, as a matter of fact, from the Vietnam War (Figure 10-3).  There are lots that you know; let me mention two or three you might not know.  There was a wonderful article in Aviation Week four months ago or so, sometime last fall, about a gravetomometer so sensitive that it was able to detect a pound of cocaine suspended in the middle of a 50-gallon drum of something like orange juice, I don't remember what it was.  You really can't hide things from something that can detect gravitational anomalies that fine.  Well, the Vietnam War gave us night vision that would ma. ke your bedroom look as though you were making love on the beach at Monterey at midday.  The last one's one called Rafter, and it was mentioned in a book called Spy Catcher.  Rafter is a British code name for the technique of listening to radio receivers, that is, listening to the local oscillators of radio receivers to figure out what station you are listening to.  Now people are used to the notion that they might be monitored when they are transmitting, I think that's perfectly natural.  But think about the fact that people might be listening to hear what you are receiving, what things you're interested in getting.

Insert Fig. 10-4 & caption "Figure 10-4"

Against that I can find very few means of increasing privacy -- I don't guarantee there aren't others -- certainly crypto is a technology with the capacity to increase people's privacy (Figure 10-4).  And I think all these cases, the first couple in any event, are fairly obvious and desperately needed -- security in telephone communications even more so, security in electronic mail.

Two far less obvious things have been developing over the last few years, things that require the provision of actual anonymity, and at the same time prevent you from making use of your anonymity to cheat -- those are electronic elections and electronic money.

Insert Fig. 10-5 & caption "Figure 10-5"

It's also true that cryptography has developed capacities that allow it to increase accountability (Figure 10-5).  In short, if you look at the previous slide (Figure 10-4), increase in anonymity where appropriate, here increased accountability.  Digital signatures give you the capacity to audit, just the way you audit a classical ledger, the same format at least.  You look at the handwriting of each individual entry in the ledger, you know who did it, you have accountability for the actions that the ledger covers. Digital signatures give you that capacity in electronic media and auditing is the basis for investigations.  It is the c. apacity of investigations to discover what did happen -- to find out who was accountable is the essence of people's being held answerable for their actions.

Insert Fig. 10-6 & caption "Figure 10-6"

Let me get to the policy difficulty (Figure 10-6).  I think cryptography offers, or at least appears to offer, something that as far as I can see is unprecedented.  I mean, if you get in the spirit of the mathematics -- and I emphasize that nobody knows for sure -- but it almost looks as though an individual might be able to, in a systematic way-- for example, with a mass-marketed piece of software -- protect information in such a way that the concerted efforts of society aren't going to be able to get at it.  I mean, no safe you can procure has that property, right? The strongest safes won't stand an hour against oxygen lances.  But cryptography may be different from that.

Insert Fig. 10-7 & caption "Figure 10-7"

Before I go any further, I'm going to say that in practice, it might turn out to be not so different from that.  As you try to implement cryptography, you find that you begin to think, well, maybe this isn't so much a mathematical problem any more.  Maybe this is an arms race, and we've got to develop a better technique and they'll develop a better technique.  Because of the problem of electromagnetic radiation out of your equipment, particularly the plain text contaminating and modulating the transmitted cipher text signal, the tamper-resistance of your equipment and the quality of your ability to generate unpredictable numbers are absolutely crucial (Figure 10-7).  And those are all issues of physical science.  So I put that bee in your bonnets -- worry a little when you write your crypto programs and things.  I've heard some fairly cocksure statements around here, you know, "Anybody could implement this," and "How's there any hope of controlling it?", etc.  Well, it's not always that easy.

Now we will turn for just one instance to the previous slide (Fig. ure 10-6) and say, from my point of view, that this, in fact, has a lot to be said for it.  I understand why the police don't like it.  But let me suggest that a very large part, if not the essence, of the distinction between a free society and a totalitarian society consists of the difference between being answerable for your actions and being subject to prior restraint on actions that the society doesn't approve of.  (applause)  What this means is, in essence, if you look at it, the subpoena sort of model.  They've got to come to you and say, "Whit, show us these records or you sit in jail for a while." And I get to decide, as reporters unfortunately have to decide, whether I'd rather sit in jail than show this court the information they want.  What I think is utterly inappropriate is they can go to some third party, the keepers of the disk that I have my stuff on, and say, "Either you show us Whit's stuff or you go to jail for a while." And you know, it's not their data, what do they care? OK.

Insert Fig. 10-8 & caption "Figure 10-8"

I really believe, long-term, that there are some serious problems here (Figure 10-8).  I think telecommunications violates a locality property that has been the basis of society.  If I come into town to negotiate with somebody, I really can't be confident that I won't be noticed going in and out of town.  If I have to stay over in the hotel, I leave a record there, etc.  If calls can be made that are somehow completely anonymous, completely secure, any two people could be in contact, and the whole way that we understand what groups are in the society would dissolve.  I think, in a peculiar way, the lack of security in communication has taken the place of this locality.  That is, you can call somebody up and conspire with them by phone, but you can't be sure that you will not have been overheard.  You don't have the same confidence that you do if you go sneak off behind the haystack to encounter this person.  And so I wonder if soci. ety, in the sense we know it, would exist in the presence of absolutely unaccountable communication between any pair of people, as much as that notion appeals to me tremendously.

Insert Fig. 10-9 & caption "Figure 10-9"

The next point, and I think a very down-to-earth one, is that traditionally we have these principles of freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of information (Figure 10-9). But we are moving into a society where information is a commodity.  And societies have always regulated commodities, so what possible hope do we have of keeping the information definitely unregulated? Cryptography is a technology with the potential to make data unregulatable in many cases, so I think we have to expect a lot of opposition to a lot of its uses.

Insert Fig. 10-10 & caption "Figure 10-10"

I think, however, that there's certainly something to be said for the notion that data are less dangerous than matter.  I mean, it may be dangerous if I stand up here and explain how an H-bomb works, but it's nothing like as dangerous as if I brought an H-bomb with me.  (laughter)

Insert Fig. 10-11 & caption "Figure 10-11"

So now I come to the issue, how well could cryptography be regulated? I think this is a case where -- I think John Barlow quoted this slogan -- if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.  I think that actually applies much better in this case because cryptography grows much more naturally out of mainstream computer science than ordnance technology does out of mainstream home machining.  Virtually everybody does cryptography on standard microprocessors or digital signal processors unless they want to go really, really fast.  I mean, people build lots of special purpose crypto chips but lots of people also do it on standard processors for the same reason that everybody does everything on standard processors -- that's the cheap way to do it.  You can do crypto in very small programs.  Even DES, which is a rather large complicated crypto system. , is not a very large program, as programs go.  And I think now, looking at that slogan, right?, if you pass a law against using cryptography in some circumstances, all of the people who are normally law-abiding will abide by it, but somebody who really wants to get messages through will build covert channels to carry them.  We discovered in computer security that even within the rather controlled environment of computer operating systems, bits move through covert channels rather freely and they are very hard to find and very hard to limit.  So, as a result, the enforcement of any such rules would probably require very drastic measures.

Insert Fig. 10-12 & caption "Figure 10-12"

Well, down to the last two points here.  I think that if you do what seems to be proposed in these various bills that come up, which is to limit the quality of security technology available to individuals, that you risk limiting two things (Figure 10-12).  In the first place, you risk the accountability of the government and the society itself. That is to say, that everybody worries, and I think correctly so, that warrants may not be necessary to some people.  The fact they can't present the evidence they gained by their warrant-less wiretaps doesn't mean they can't then build other evidence based on them.

The second point is that a lot of the cases are going to be exposing you to the actions of somebody other than the courts and the sheriff and the FBI, so they're effectively saying, you have to accept the level of protection we provide you in whatever way -- you aren't allowed to protect yourself.  Now it seems to be one thing to say that you can't have a tommy gun in your house to protect yourself against burglars, and quite another thing to say that you can't have a really strong door.  I think that's a much more similar analogy. There's also a very interesting precedent for this, I think, in the copy protection technology of things like digital audiotapes.  In some sense, putting cop. y protection in digital audiotapes supports not only the interest of Columbia Records but it supports the interest of the black market. If I'm selling black market audiotapes which I copied from legitimate ones by building an illegal -- I don't even know if it's illegal, but you build from scratch -- a nonrestricting copier.  Now I've copied copy-protected tapes. I mean, I don't want my customers copying their own tapes -- I want them coming to me.  (laughter)

Insert Fig. 10-13 & caption "Figure 10-13"

So, what could we do?  The answer is, I don't know.  I have in mind a compromise (Figure 10-13), but I don't know how to do it.  I think if you could guarantee accountability of the society, that is to say, you could say, data always could be subject to search warrants, but nobody could ever do it covertly.  It would be like having perfect signet ring seals to go on envelopes so that if your letter was opened you would know that some warrant had been served and your letter had been opened.  The trouble is, unfortunately, I have no idea how to do that.  Thanks for your patience.  (applause)

D. DENNING: OK, before opening it up to questions from the floor, I'd like to ask the panelists if any of them have very short comments that they want to make in response to each other said.  John?

BARLOW: I'd just like to say that if people in the audience or if people who speak to people in the audience are interested in working on this and being part of the negotiations about the transfer of mass market software, talk to Jerry Berman of the EFF Washington Office, or John Podesta.

D. DENNING: Yes?

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  I just had a very brief comment on something John Barlow said.  He commented on the oddity of a secret cryptographic standard.  I think in fact secret standards of various kinds aren't that uncommon.  What's especially odd about this one is that this one's an ANSI standard, and they had to bend the rules very hard to get around the fact that it's ANSI rules th. at their standards have to be publicized.  There is a wonderful story, but it's too long, the things it went through, but it's too long to give at the moment.

D. DENNING: OK.  Well, we're open to questions from the floor.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Knowing that both CFPs have made a concerted effort to provide a level playing field for discussion of controversial issues, I may have missed this in the beginning in your introduction, if so, I apologize.  Why isn't anyone from the NSA, CIA, and the FBI on this platform?

D. DENNING: OK, that's a good question.  I was not the person who actually organized the session, however, after I was invited to be chair of the session, I talked with the person who organized it, who's Marc Rotenberg, about that very issue.  And Marc had already talked to some people in the government and hadn't gotten anywhere in terms of their interest in participating, so I called up somebody I know at the NSA.  That person put me in contact with somebody else in the agency who would be in a position to make the decision, or maybe even be the appropriate person to have on the panel, and he explained to me that they would decline because they didn't feel that they could say the things in a public forum that they would need to say.  He also, though, on the positive side of it, which I interpreted as somewhat encouraging, said he thought that maybe a year from now that we would see the NSA participating more in public discussions about this, that at this time it was premature.  Now, as far as the FBI goes, I was under the impression that maybe Marc or somebody had approached the FBI as well, but I'm not exactly sure.  I'd be delighted to have somebody from the FBI join us right now and either make a few comments or respond to questions that come up.  It is certainly not an intention to exclude people from the government at all.

PANEL MEMBER: Oh, by the way, there is a representative from NSA here, she's Sandra Ray, and she's sitting in the audience taki. ng notes.  (laughter)

D. DENNING: OK, you're next.

PANEL MEMBER: But your sponsors are taping.  (laughter)

ERIC HUGHES: I'm Eric Hughes of DigiCash.  I have a question for Jim Bidzos which is rather impertinent.  We know from experiences of the last year that, as in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, governmental power is in large cases what people believe it to be.  Now we know that Phil Zimmerman has challenged the legality of patent law in response to software patents by writing PGP -- Pretty Good Privacy.  When will RSA Data Security simply export RSA technology out of the boundaries of the country and see what the government does? (applause)

BIDZOS: I'm not sure I see a relationship between the two things you said -- patent law and exporting cryptography don't...

HUGHES: They're both challenges to the existing form of legality that's been created by the government.

BIDZOS: Let me just understand your position -- you're anti- patent law.  You wish there were no patents...

HUGHES: I don't have a particular position on this. DigiCash, as a corporate representative, has a patent on the blind signature, just like you have a patent on the RSA signature.

BIDZOS: There are lots of patents and lots of companies that have them.  I'm not sure what your patent question is.

HUGHES: My question is really about export law -- that's my real question.

BIDZOS: I see.  When are we going to ignore export law and ship RSA, say, out of the country?

HUGHES: As a form of civil disobedience made by a corporation rather than an individual. (hoots)

BIDZOS: Well, maybe I already have. (laughter and applause)

HUGHES: Are you willing to certify that with a public key signature? (laughter)

BIDZOS: A DSS signature? Absolutely. (laughter) Yes, I'll sign anything with one of those.  (laughter and hoots)  But I ... (interruption) Let me just repeat that maybe I already have, and if I did, I don't think it would be a good idea for me to admit it.

HUGHES: Well, the . whole point is to admit it and see what the government does. (laughter and hoots)

BIDZOS: Easy for you to say.

HUGHES: Cryptography is the civil liberties issue of the 21st century and we might as well start now.

BIDZOS: Now that I understand your question, let me answer it this way.  We've taken the first step to doing that.  We have made a piece of software called RSA REF, which is RSA and DES together -- not for the first time, but together again (laughter) -- available in source code form to anybody who wants it who is willing to acknowledge that they won't break the law.  I mean, I don't care what you do, but you have to tell me that you're not going to break the law.  So, all you have to do is send electronic mail to RSAREF-REQUEST at RSA.COM and you can take that step yourself, too.

HUGHES: From CWI.NL, I take it, as well.

D. DENNING: I'd like to go on to somebody else.  Thanks. OK, Steve Cisler?

STEVE CISLER: My question is for anyone, including Dorothy. With a lot of federal agencies really searching around how to mold swords into plowshares, what do you think the NSA will be doing maybe in the next year that they won't be here?

BIDZOS: I have an answer, because I get asked this a lot.  I have a view that may be different from what most people feel. I think NSA's budget is likely to be increased, and that is simply because if I were perhaps a Congressional representative or an NSA representative sitting in the meetings where money is appropriated, I think my question would be, well gee, now we've agreed to cut the defense budget by $50-100 billion over the next five or ten years, that means we'll have a leaner, meaner military and our response time would be longer.  Who would like to be the first to vote against a modest increase in our ability to give ourselves more lead time? I don't think anybody would. So I suspect that if anything, NSA and their interests are likely to be as strong or stronger than they have in the past.

CISLER: Do you . think there'll be any kind of agreement such as the Energy Department just signed with the Computer Systems Policy Project? Sort of joint development of research?

BELLIN: If there is, I don't think we're going to know about it. (laughter)

D. DENNING: Vint Cerf?

VINT CERF: Hello, hello.  I have a couple of things to mention, and one question to ask.  First of all, I wanted to make sure before I ask my question that everyone understands I have a great deal of interest in making it possible for privacy-enhanced mail using various cryptographic techniques to be readily available essentially everywhere, at least throughout the Internet.  So steps that move in that direction are in fact helpful.  However, I want to ask you all to think a little bit for a moment before you decide to totally damn various parts of the US Government.  A lot of those people who are out there who have to work in secret do so at great risk.  And they do that to defend each of us.  So before you decide that some of the policies that in fact go against our grain and our natural desire for openness, before you decide that those are completely wrong and unacceptable, I hope you'll give a little bit of thought to the people who go out there and defend us in secret and do so at great risk. We don't pay them for that, at least nothing except perhaps our taxes, but you know, you can't pay anybody to risk their lives.  So I hope you'll give a little bit of thought to that before you decide those guys are all bad guys.  Thanks. (applause)

GILMORE: I don't think we should destroy our privacy to protect it, the way in Vietnam we destroyed our villages to protect them.  (applause)

D. DENNING: Richard?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: OK, thank you very much.  We hear a lot of arguing about the First Amendment foundation for cryptographic speech.  I'm beginning to wonder about the Second Amendment implications.  We've heard several times on the panel here today, and I think some of us through other conversations . during the last couple of days, that if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns, and by analogy if crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have crypto.  One of the purposes of cryptographic technique is to protect an individual from outside intrusion, either from others or perhaps from a government run amok, which is certainly an undercurrent that I've sensed here.  Taking a look at some of the fundamental historical purposes of the Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights, I'm curious what the application of the Second Amendment would be to cryptographic protection. And I'll just throw that open to the panel.  "The right to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged."

BELLIN: Maybe I'll take a first stab at that, since I was the first one to introduce the analogy today.  I would reflect back on why the right to keep and bear arms was included in the Bill of Rights -- that might be one way to approach it. Was it to keep taxes low so you wouldn't have to have a standing army? Or was it as another mechanism of preserving what I talked about as the fundamental freedoms of our society which I see, more personally, in First Amendment terms -- to speak freely, the right to associate in order to affect the course of government, those whom we've turned over the reins to, to some extent? So, if that was the purpose, in other words, in order to prevent a British tyranny from coming back, or something along those orders, then we have a better parallel to what we're talking about in cryptographic techniques, I think.

BARLOW: I have an anecdote for you on this point -- this does keep coming up.  When I was talking to Admiral Inman about this, he equated robust encryption with Saturday night specials.  He said, "My answer would be legislation which would make it a criminal offense to use encrypted communication to conceal criminal activity." So I said, "Wouldn't that render all encrypted traffic somewhat suspect?" And he said, "Well, you could have a registry of institutions. which could legally use ciphers.  If you get somebody using one who isn't registered, then you go after him."  I said, "You can have my encryption algorithm when you pry my cold, dead fingers from its private key." (laughter and applause)

D. DENNING: Marc Rotenberg?

MARC ROTENBERG: I have an announcement, a comment, and a question.  First, I am pleased to announce that the Second Conference on Cryptography Policy will be held in Washington, DC, on June 1, and is being jointly sponsored by CPSR, EFF, and RSA.  Second, it seems that these issues are beginning to mushroom, which is to say that a year ago we were talking about S.266.  Now we're talking about a vastly expanded proposal regarding the digital network.  The next level, I suspect, has to do with the intelligence overhaul which is now being discussed in both the House and Senate.  In particular, there are proposals to give statutory authority to the National Security Agency in the area of information security and communications security.  The Senate bill gives authority to NSA for all communications security for the federal government; the House bill gives authority to the NSA for all information security for the federal government.  My question, I guess, may be to John Gilmore: What should we anticipate as this clash between emerging technologies and protection of the national security state plays itself out? What are the next battles going to be over?

D. DENNING: Could I just make a comment first, and that is that my understanding in talking with Willis Ware yesterday was that there was a mistake in those bills that is being rectified.  I'm not sure what the actual intent of the bills was, but the intent of the bills was not actually to give NSA more authority over security than they already had, and the Computer Security Act gives NIST authority for security in the commercial sector.  There are some people from NIST here, so maybe they can correct me on this.

UNKNOWN PANEL MEMBER: Is Willis here? .

D. DENNING: Willis is not here any more.  Is there anybody here who is more knowledgeable?

ROTENBERG: Dorothy, let me just say I've read both of the bills -- it's S.2198 and it's H.R.4165, section 314...

D. DENNING: No, they were clearly written, but I guess the question is they were written without somebody having done the right research, and the research having been done, the plan is to change that.  Can you speak to that?

WAYNE MADSEN: I'm Wayne Madsen.  What I heard yesterday was that they said inadvertently some staffers who had prepared the legislation used some old language because they weren't up on what was going on here now.  I'll leave that up to you to believe or not, but they're saying mea culpa.

D. DENNING: Anyway, I guess the question was actually directed to John, so let's let John go next, and then Whit, if you want say something, too.

GILMORE: I think the question is just sort of, where's the next battleground going to be? Overall, I think that the battleground is on what are we losing by following these cold war policies.  It's clear that there was no reason to doubt what the NSA said over the last 40 or 50 years, because there was no harm if you followed their regulations.  Maybe 10 people got hurt, or 20 people got hurt that year, and you could afford that for national security.  But when the privacy of millions of people who have cellular telephones and the integrity of our computer networks and our PCs against viruses are up for grabs here, then I think the battleground is going to be counting up the harm and in the public policy debate trying to strike a balance.  The real challenge there will be to get the people who can show harm on the other side, who can show harm to our national security by freeing the technology, to speak up and tell us what this harm is.  They're so unused to having to defend the need for it that I'm afraid they will just sort of attempt to push it to the wire, and whether they win or lose is not the issue..

The result will be not what's best for the country, just because we don't know what's best for the country, because we can't evaluate both sides of the equation. (applause)

D. DENNING: OK, and then Whit?

DIFFIE: Marc, I'm not so convinced that's a bad thing.  My experience of NSA is that the people who work in COMSEC seem to me really have the security of American communications as their interest.  And it's not obvious to me that a group of the sort we've had for the last several years, without particular resources in the Department of Commerce, is any less subject to the influence of the offensive side of NSA -- which might want some compromise for the sake of intelligence sources -- that that's any less subject to influence than the COMSEC side of NSA is to influence.  There was originally scheduled the STU-3 program would have supplied Type 2 STU-3s rather freely within the United States.  At least the excuse that is given for the program having been changed to where now only approved people with law enforcement, big companies, etc., can get them, is that the Computer Security Act allegedly deprived them of the authority to have such a broad program with influence over the civil sector.

GILMORE: It'll be quick.  I think there's no problem with having the computer security people at NSA do the work.  The problem is to move them out from under the NSA umbrella so that they are subject to the FOIA, they are subject to all the reviews and all the other constraints that every other government agency is subject to.

D. DENNING: And Jim Bidzos wanted to make a brief remark, too.

BIDZOS: Marc, I think this legislation is somewhat unique.  I mean, this basically says, in the interest of law enforcement, give me the right to do whatever I need to and accuse whoever I need to of breaking the law.  It could be abused.  There's no question about that.  And I think people are a lot smarter today, and they're saying, "Prove to us that there's some protection in here f. or law-abiding people before we implement this thing."  This is a wonderful form of government, but there's no way to ensure that we don't elect corrupt officials, and history is full of examples where that's happened before, so these things tend to be abused. The language in S.266 in particular, and also in this digital telephony bill, seems to me to just open the door to possible abuse.  An example is in Cincinnati, Ohio.  For about five or six years running, the local police and Cincinnati Bell worked together -- colluded -- to make literally thousands of illegal wiretaps.  It happens all the time.  And all we're saying is, "Gee, we're smarter these days, you know, we're not so dumb -- we're not going to just take this thing the way it is.  Why don't you prove to us that it can't be abused?" We're not willing to trust the government any more. So maybe the next battlefield ought to be the next election -- let's make this a major issue and let's lobby.  (applause)

D. DENNING: Ross Stapleton?

ROSS STAPLETON: Ross Stapleton, Central Intelligence Agency, and I have to say up front I don't speak for the CIA and this is just me.  I can tell you I did my doctoral work studying Soviet-East European personal computing.  I have seen export controls and all that close at hand, and actually kicked the tires and things and all that.  I can say I agreed nearly 100% with what Mr. Diffie said, up until he said something that surprised me, in that this room didn't shout it down. That was when he said information is less dangerous than physical things.  Good God! If you believe that, I'll give you a choice.  I can go to your school district and give out one hit of PCP, or I can cover the area with instructions on how to make it.  All I'd ask you to keep in mind is to have some sympathy for the foreign policy-niks who know that, in a sort of frustrated air, when it's hard to move information around, it's unlikely that someone can even get an atomic bomb plan, despite the fact tha. t we've got tens of thousands in both the former Soviet Union and in the United States. But I would fear someone giving out the Princeton dissertation and broadcasting it over the nets to all and sundry in that form -- now, given plutonium, we can make a bomb.  So, information is a dangerous thing, in the right hands.  I think we're all selling ourselves short if we think information is an unempowered commodity.

All that said, I have to agree with everything else. Cryptography is not magic, it's math, and DES is not only here, it's on a server in Helsinki, so we have to live with the fact that information moves around.  We may want to be sympathetic to the fact that there are people, in fact people without the tools that we all have here, trying to enact the current and past foreign policy.  Help educate them, help tell them why these things are happening, but realize that we're disrupting a lot of things real fast.

BARLOW: The problem with trying to regulate the flow of information, which is a little like trying to regulate the flow of wind, is that it's quite possible to keep it out of the hands of individuals and small institutions; it's very difficult to keep it out of the hands of large institutions. So you have, in effect, a situation where the Soviets are using RSA in their large codes, and have for a long time, and yet we can't use it as individuals in the United States.  And that's just dumb.

BIDZOS: My revenue forecasts are being revised downward, by the way. (laughter)

BARLOW: You weren't getting royalties on that anyway, were you?  (laughter)

BIDZOS: Maybe. (laughter and applause)

D. DENNING: John Podesta?

JOHN PODESTA: I have no speech, but I actually have two somewhat unrelated questions, if you will bear with me.  Whit Diffie talked about using encryption to enhance the capacity to audit, but in the case of the cellular standard, I think the NSA spent most of their time worrying about encryption used in the signaling channel, rather than . the voice channel on cellular, because they wanted the capacity to audit or do traffic analysis, transactional analysis.  I wanted to ask Whit whether the use of encryption can enhance privacy in that area, which is to eliminate, or build up privacy on transactional analysis.  Secondly, to Jim Bidzos, you talked about going from a situation where government and industry are fighting with one another to one in which there's more cooperation, and I wanted a comment on whether you thought the SPA negotiation with NSA was of the latter category.

DIFFIE: My answer is that cryptography can certainly be applied in such a way as to protect transactions from auditing, that is in effect what electronic money does -- it creates anonymous transactions.  On the other hand, when you want that effect, it can be used to enhance the auditability of a sequence of transactions.

BIDZOS: Let me try to set the record straight on this SPA business -- I'm not a member of SPA, I haven't been part of these negotiations.  Apparently someone at the companies involved has a fondness for some of our DES alternatives and uses them.  These alternative algorithms that we're in the business of designing and selling have variable key sizes. We give them to our customers who choose a key size suitable to their application and go and attempt to get their complete package exported.  I play no role in the process once they buy these particular algorithms from us.  I've only recently -- very recently -- heard about this business in SPA.  I have no detailed knowledge of what's going on, what's been negotiated, and what the key sizes are, so I'm afraid I really can't answer your question without understanding all the details.  But, I mean, if it's a secret meeting, it doesn't sound very good.

PODESTA: You would at least support John's notion that it ought to be put out in the open and opened up to public discourse, right?

BIDZOS: Well, I support my own notion that one ought to learn a lot about some. thing before one comments on it. (laughter)

D. DENNING: OK, I guess the clock just ran out and Lance said he had a couple of comments he wanted to make before the break.

HOFFMAN: Well, that clock says zero, but don't go away, you people who are at the microphones.  I have a couple of comments.  This says 2:56, so let's take two or three more...

D. DENNING: OK. Two more?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have no questions, but I have two comments.  Briefly, it seems to be clear-cut lunacy for DES to be spread all over the world and for us not to be able to export it legally.  It seems lunacy to me for public key crypto to be published worldwide and be used worldwide while US citizens cannot use it for communication with the rest of the world that already uses it.  And it simply makes the government look dumb.  So why don't they let it go? Just let go.  OK, that's one comment.

Second, I have a lot of sympathy for law enforcement officers who are having to face the DDR&M -- that is, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers.  But it is a serious comment, I do have a lot of sympathy for them.  They are under severe duress from us, the law-abiding citizens who want protection from these serious crimes and this serious danger.  Maybe we should move to another society where it's OK to pry information out of suspects' brains by beating them until they tell us.  That's done all over the world.  Why don't we do it? We decided that was going too far.  Maybe we need to decide that the protection of communications between presumed innocent individuals supersedes the need of law enforcement for the ability to conduct surveillance and investigation on information and communications between any individuals that they want to when authorized by law, or by political process, or by whoever's in power, or by whatever other means there is, authorized or unauthorized.  We as a society really need to make a decision whether we want everybody protected, even those damn DDR&Ms, or whether we want every. body endangered. Thank you.

HOFFMAN: I have a couple of announcements before the break. One -- plans are underway to establish an Illinois Privacy Council.  Interested people should contact George Trubow -- stand up, anybody who hasn't seen George, this is who he is - - 312-987-1445.  No 800 number.  Second announcement -- some of you may not have had a chance to look at the followup program to the initial brochure.  The last session at 3:15 -- in fifteen minutes -- it's going to be dynamite.  Mara Liasson from NPR is going to chair, and the panelists are Peter Denning from George Mason University, Mitch Kapor from Electronic Frontier Foundation, Simon Davies from Privacy International, Roland Homet from Executive Ink, and Esther Dyson from EDventure Holding, so it should be quite a session.  I look forward to seeing you all there.  Finally, Bruce Koball has a very quick announcement to make.

KOBALL: For the folks that weren't here this morning when I was formally drafted with my arm twisted behind my back into chairing CFP-3, I'd like to make a request that people that have an interest in participating in CFP-3, which looks like it's going to be held in San Francisco next year at around this time.  Please talk to me before you leave here and give me some of your ideas.  We hope we can include you in the program planning process.  Thank you. (applause)

HOFFMAN: Thank you, Bruce, and finally, Molly Raphael reminds me, if you have not filled out your evaluation form, this might be an interesting time to consider it and drop it off at the registration desk.  Thank you very much to Dorothy and the panel for a very interesting discussion.  (applause).

Legal Assistance from EFF
=========================

Please be respectful of the time of our attorneys. Direct all legal inquiries, not to the individual attorney, but to [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org). All inquiries will be routed to [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org). For expedited responses to media inquiries, please email [press@eff.org](mailto:press@eff.org).

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been working since 1990 to ensure that the civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are applied to cutting edge communication technologies. Blending the expertise of lawyers, policy analysts, activists, and technologists, EFF achieves significant victories on behalf of consumers, innovators, coders and the general public. One of EFF's chief tools is fighting for freedom is in the U.S. courts, bringing and defending lawsuits even when that means taking on the U.S. government or large corporations. This page is to give you a rough idea of what we consider when evaluating whether to take a case and our general intake process.

**Can we take your case?**

_Note: Communications with EFF made for the purpose of securing legal counsel are protected by the attorney/client privilege regardless of whether EFF ultimately takes your case._

EFF is a donor-funded nonprofit organization and depends on support from the public to successfully defend your digital rights. Litigation can be expensive and time-consuming; a single case can take years of hard work by many different lawyers. Because our budget is based on donations from individuals and foundations who want to see us affect the law and Internet freedom quickly and broadly, we are very careful to maximize our impact when we litigate. Requests for legal help should be sent to [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org) (and not to EFF's other staffers, please).

The decision about what cases to take directly as counsel usually begins with consideration of the following criteria:

1\. EFF would substantially affect case law on a relevant area of law by litigating. This means that the case is on the forefront of the law concerning new technologies. A decision will help to define how the law is applied in future cases. This criteria can result in EFF taking cases that turn on legal interpretations, rather than ones turning on factual disputes, since cases based on factual disputes usually are less likely to create a wide impact and are more expensive and time-consuming to litigate.

2\. EFF would help far more than one party by litigating. Sometimes this means taking the first case on a legal issue, since a good early ruling on a key issue will help many others down the line. Sometimes this means we'll file a class action lawsuit. And sometimes this means we'll defend someone who is the first (or who presents the strongest case) of many actual or likely defendants.

3\. The case is in keeping with our mission and is appropriate to our expertise. We generally avoid cases that involve areas of law in which we do not specialize (like tax or immigration law), even if they also involve the internet, electronic surveillance, or other technologies. We also avoid cases where the facts aren't sufficiently related to digital issues.

4\. The person seeking our help or the issue at stake cannot be addressed by the regular legal marketplace. EFF exists to take the sorts of cases that commercial attorneys cannot -- often because, despite the importance of the issues, the parties involved cannot afford counsel. If there are financially capable parties defending the Internet freedom position, we're more likely to choose to file an amicus brief rather than to represent a party directly--and sometimes we just watch from the sidelines. That way, we can reserve our limited resources for the many situations in which our pro bono help is needed.

We appreciate your understanding that we are only able to take on the cases of a small percentage of people who contact the EFF for help. By carefully selecting what we choose to take on, we make the most of our attorneys' expertise and our members' donations.

**What if we can't take your case?**

EFF maintains a list of attorneys, called the Cooperating Attorneys list, who have told us that they are passionate about the same things we're passionate about, and who have indicated that they have some of the same areas of expertise. If we can't help you, but feel that your case is something our cooperating attorneys may be able to assist with, we'll offer to refer you to one of them. When we do, we send basic information about your circumstances to our cooperating attorneys email list. We will send the contact information of any interested attorneys to you.

_Please note that we do not screen or evaluate the attorneys on the Cooperating Attorneys list. Each person referred to a lawyer from the list should make their own independent evaluation of whether the referred attorney is the right one for the particular issue._

The Cooperating Attorneys list is private and confidential. Nonetheless, there is always a chance that an attorney who is adverse to you is either on the list or will receive our message to the list improperly. Because of this, we are careful about what information we send to the list. (For example, we do not usually disclose the actual names of those seeking help.) If there is any information you wish not to be disclosed in emails to the cooperating attorney email list, please be sure to let us know.

When we hear back from attorneys interested in your case, we will forward you their contact information. We ask that you use the subject line: EFF Referral when contacting people to whom we refer you.

While we can try to refer you for pro bono (free) representation by an attorney, please consider that requiring pro bono assistance may make it less likely that we'll be able to find someone to help. If you are requesting legal advice on a project from which you hope to make money, it's especially appropriate to pay for counsel. EFF is not paid by the attorneys on the Cooperating Attorneys list, and we follow the legal and ethical guidelines for referrals made through the list.

_It bears repeating, just in case it's not yet clear: we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refer you to an attorney who will take your case, especially on a pro-bono basis._

**What if you just want basic legal information?**

Feel free to send your query to [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org). But first, _please search the EFF website_, which is chock full of helpful information and may answer your question entirely. Since EFF's website contains so much information, it's a great idea to see if we've already answered your question by using the search box on the upper right hand corner of any eff.org page.

If you don't find what you're looking for, it's possible that we can help you with some basic information, but please understand that we _**cannot and will not give you legal advice**_ unless we affirmatively agree to take on your case. Note also that the line between information and legal advice can be fine, and we may tell you that you need to speak to another lawyer even if you think you're only seeking legal information. In many cases, your local bar association (usually organized by county) can provide the best help--most offer referrals to low cost consultations.

**What if EFF says no?**

There are many reasons for which we may not be able to help you directly or provide you with a referral. Sometimes both our attorneys and our cooperating attorneys are simply too busy to take on another case. Sometimes the issue doesn't impact enough people. Sometimes your issue is too far outside our area of emphasis. Sometimes the help you need isn't legal help at all.

If we can't offer you a referral, we'll try to help you find another resource. When in doubt, however, your local bar association is always a good place to start.





Security Vulnerability Disclosure Program
=========================================

_Also check out our [EFF Security Hall of Fame](https://www.eff.org/security/hall-of-fame) to see the heroes that have already reported security vulnerabilities to us!_

### Overview

EFF is committed to protecting the privacy and security of users of our software tools. Our Vulnerability Disclosure Program is intended to minimize the impact any security flaws have on our tools or their users. EFF's Vulnerability Disclosure Program covers select software partially or primarily written by EFF.

### Scope: Software Written by EFF

EFF's Vulnerability Disclosure Program applies to security vulnerabilities discovered in any of the following software:

- [HTTPS Everywhere (for Chrome and Firefox)](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere)
- [Privacy Badger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerchrome)
- [Certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot)
- [Boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder)

In order to qualify, the vulnerability must exist in the latest public release (including officially released public betas) of the software. Only security vulnerabilities will qualify. We would love it if people reported other bugs via the appropriate channels, but since the purpose of this program is to fix security vulnerabilities, only bugs that lead to security vulnerabilities will be eligible for rewards. Other bugs will be accepted at our discretion.

### Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines in order to be eligible for rewards under this disclosure program:

- Do not permanently modify or delete EFF-hosted data.
- Do not intentionally access non-public EFF data any more than is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Do not DDoS or otherwise disrupt, interrupt or degrade our internal or external services.
- Do not share confidential information obtained from EFF, including but not limited to member or donor payment information, with any third party.
- Social engineering is out of scope. Do not send phishing emails to, or use other social engineering techniques against, anyone, including EFF staff, members, vendors, or partners.

In addition, please allow EFF at least 90 days to fix the vulnerability before publicly discussing or blogging about it. EFF believes that security researchers have a First Amendment right to report their research and that disclosure is highly beneficial, and understands that it is a highly subjective question of when and how to hold back details to mitigate the risk that vulnerability information will be misused. If you believe that earlier disclosure is necessary, please let us know so that we can begin a conversation.

### Reporting

Just as important as discovering security flaws is reporting the findings so that users can protect themselves and vendors can repair their products. Public disclosure of security information enables informed consumer choice and inspires vendors to be truthful about flaws, repair vulnerabilities, and build more secure products. Disclosure and peer review advances the state of the art in security. Researchers can figure out where new technologies need to be developed, and the information can help policymakers understand where problems tend to occur.

On the other hand, vulnerability information can give attackers who were not otherwise sophisticated enough to find the problem on their own the very information they need to exploit a security hole in a computer or system and cause harm. Therefore we ask that you privately report the vulnerability to EFF before public disclosure.

Send an email to [vulnerabilities@eff.org](mailto:vulnerabilities@eff.org) using the [GPG key located here](https://www.eff.org/files/vulnerabilities_at_eff.txt), with information about the vulnerability and detailed steps on how to replicate it. Submissions that include detailed information on how to fix the corresponding vulnerability are more likely to receive more valuable rewards.

If you do not want to be publicly thanked on our [EFF Security Hall of Fame page](https://www.eff.org/security/hall-of-fame) (or elsewhere), please let us know that you want your submission to be confidential in your report email. We can still provide rewards for confidential submissions, if you like.

We are also happy to accept anonymous vulnerability reports, but of course we can't send you our thanks if you report a vulnerability anonymously.

We will make every effort to respond to valid reports within seven business days.

The validity of a vulnerability will be judged at the sole discretion of EFF.

[Coders’ Rights Project Vulnerability Reporting FAQ](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/vulnerability-reporting-faq)

### Rewards

Not all reported issues may qualify for a reward. Rewards are awarded at EFF's sole discretion. As a member-driven nonprofit we are unable to afford cash bounties (sorry!), but can offer non-cash rewards, including:

- Public acknowledgement on our [EFF Security Hall of Fame page](https://www.eff.org/security/hall-of-fame),
- [EFF gear (stickers, etc.)](https://supporters.eff.org/shop),
- Complimentary [EFF memberships](https://supporters.eff.org/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_donate_pages/html/membership_details.html),
- Opportunities to tour the EFF office and meet with EFF staff, and
- Complimentary tickets to EFF events like the [Pioneer Awards](https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer/) for especially severe vulnerabilities.

If you would like a particular reward (e.g., you already have a t-shirt and would prefer a sticker pack), please let us know when you report the vulnerability. While the reward EFF provides in exchange for disclosing a vulnerability under this policy will be up to the sole discretion of EFF, we will certainly take your request into consideration.

Please note that in some cases we will be unable to provide a physical reward if the shipping cost is prohibitively expensive, or if we have had difficulties shipping to your area before. In particular, at this time we are unable to ship physical rewards to India and Pakistan.

Only the first report we receive about a given vulnerability will be rewarded. We cannot send rewards where prohibited by law (i.e. North Korea, Cuba, etc.).

### Questions

If you have any questions about our vulnerability disclosure policy, please email [vulnerabilities@eff.org](mailto:vulnerabilities@eff.org) ( [GPG key](https://www.eff.org/files/vulnerabilities_at_eff.txt)).

## EFF Cooperating Techs Announce List

EFF is often contacted by attorneys or members of the general public who have a need for technical assistance. The Cooperating Techs list is a low volume mailing list that connects these people with technologists who have the expertise and the desire to assist. We will post a note to the list with a basic description of the project or need; if you are qualified and interested, you respond to the call, and we'll connect you to the attorney. EFF won't investigate or vouch for either side so it is up to both parties to negotiate the work arrangements. We'll simply provide the connection.

## EFF Cooperating Attorneys List

EFF receives many requests for legal assistance. In order to try to find help for as many people as possible, we maintain a post-only email list that attorneys can join called the Cooperating Attorneys list. The list receives anonymized requests for help, both directly on EFF cases and on cases where the EFF cannot offer assistance. If you are an attorney who is interested in joining the list, please contact the Legal Intake Coordinator at [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org) with the subject line, "Cooperating Attorney List Inquiry". More general information about the list can be found on our [Legal Assistance](https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance#coopatty) page.

## Designing with EFF

EFF has a team of staff designers who create the [stunning artwork](https://www.flickr.com/photos/electronicfrontierfoundation "EFF Flickr page") we use on our sites and in our campaigns. Thanks to the talent we have on staff, we don't generally have much immediate need for volunteer design help, but there are still some ways that artists, designers, photographers and other visual thinkers can contribute.

Designers with expertise in UI and UX may wish to contribute to one of our many open source projects. See our [Coding with EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/volunteer/coding-with-eff) page, which has information on how to contribute to our [Open Source Design Repository](https://github.com/EFForg/design "EFF design on Github") on Github.

Artists, illustrators, photographers, and poster or meme designers may wish to share their work through the online Commons. We encourage the use of a [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ "CC Attribution License") for visual works; if you can post it to a public online forum, and then alert our design team to its existence, we would be happy to consider using it. We especially appreciate images that reflect all sorts of Internet users in the world; particular projects we are especially inspired by include [WOC in Tech Stock Photos](https://www.wocintechchat.com/blog/wocintechphotos "WOC in Tech") and [Safersisters Gifs](https://medium.com/codingrights/safersisters-online-security-tips-in-gifs-222589166ed8 "Safersisters"). While we cannot promise immediate use of everything you share, we welcome your creative contributions to the Commons, and we feel it is likely that others will value your work as well.

Photographers & Illustrators: we are always looking for good stock images on a [CC-Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) featuring diverse users engaging with technologies. Hands on keyboards, hackers busy coding, [protestors holding up phones](https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-rights-and-black-led-movement-against-police-violence "Digital Rights and the Black-led Movement Against Police Violence"); these are some examples of photographic images we have looked for and found in the online Commons. Positive images of technology's potential are particularly welcome; dystopian images are also great, but easier to find.

Icon and logo designers: images that take a novel approach to representing abstract concepts such as justice, technological freedom, innovation, privacy, censorship, and political activism are particularly useful.

Online forums which enable CC licensing include, but are not limited to: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page); [Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/); [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/commons).

Please do send us a note; we would love to hear from you!

The court ruled back in 2012 that merely violating a website’s terms of use is not a crime under the federal computer crime statute, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

A History of Protecting Freedom Where Law and Technology Collide
================================================================

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in July of 1990 in response to a basic threat to speech and privacy. The United States Secret Service conducted a series of raids tracking the distribution of a document illegally copied from a BellSouth computer that described how the emergency 911 system worked, referred to as the E911 document. The Secret Service believed that if "hackers" knew how to use the telephone lines set aside for receiving emergency phone calls, the lines would become overloaded and people facing true emergencies would be unable to get through.

One of the alleged recipients of the E911 document was the systems operator at a small games book publisher out of Austin, Texas, named Steve Jackson Games. The Secret Service executed a warrant against the innocent Jackson and took all electronic equipment and copies of an upcoming game book from Steve Jackson Games' premises. Steve Jackson panicked as he watched the deadline come and go for his latest release and still hadn't received his computers back. He was forced to lay off nearly half of his staff. In the end, the Secret Service returned all of Steve Jackson's computers and decided not to press charges against the company, since they were unable to find any copies of the E911 document on any of the computers.

![](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/07/10/eff-logo-stack-rgb.png)

EFF's original logo, in use from 1990-2018

In the meantime, Steve Jackson's business was nearly ruined. And when he and his employees had the opportunity to investigate the returned computers, they noticed that all of the electronic mail that had been stored on the company's electronic bulletin board computer, where non-employee users had dialed in and sent personal messages to one another, had been individually accessed and deleted. Steve Jackson was furious, as he believed his rights as a publisher had been violated and the free speech and privacy rights of his users had been violated. Steve Jackson tried desperately to find a civil liberties group to help him, to no avail. Unfortunately, none of the existing groups understood the technology well enough to understand the importance of the issues.

In an electronic community called the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (now WELL.com) several informed technologists understood exactly what civil liberties issues were involved. Mitch Kapor, former president of Lotus Development Corporation, John Perry Barlow, Wyoming cattle rancher and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and John Gilmore, an early employee of Sun Microsystems, with assistance from Steve Wozniak, decided to do something about it. They formed an organization to work on civil liberties issues raised by new technologies. On the day they formally unveiled the new organization, they announced that they were representing Steve Jackson Games and several of the company's bulletin board users in a lawsuit they were bringing against the United States Secret Service. The Electronic Frontier Foundation was born!

The Steve Jackson Games case turned out to be an extremely important one in the development of a proper legal framework for cyberspace. For the first time, a court held that electronic mail deserves at least as much protection as telephone calls. We take for granted today that law enforcement must have a warrant that particularly describes all electronic mail messages before seizing and reading them. The Steve Jackson Games case established that principle.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation continues to take on cases that set important precedents for the treatment of rights in cyberspace. In our second big case, _Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of Justice_, the United States government prohibited a University of California mathematics Ph.D. student from publishing on the Internet an encryption computer program he had created.  Encryption is a method for scrambling messages so they can only be understood by their intended recipients. Years before, the government had placed encryption on the United States Munitions List, alongside bombs and flamethrowers, as a weapon to be regulated for national security purposes. Companies and individuals exporting items on the munitions list, including software with encryption capabilities, had to obtain prior State Department approval.

Encryption export restrictions crippled American businesses and damaged the free speech rights of individuals. Critical for ecommerce, companies use encryption to safeguard sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, which they send or receive over electronic networks. Companies also secure access to software programs and provide system security using encryption. By limiting the export of encryption, technologies, and methods, the U.S. government drove development of security software overseas, where American companies were unable to compete.

The State Department was unsympathetic to Bernstein's situation and told Bernstein he would need a license to be an arms dealer before he could simply post the text of his encryption program on the Internet. They also told him that they would deny him an export license if he actually applied for one, because his technology was too secure.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation pulled together a top-notch legal team and sued the United States government on behalf of Dan Bernstein. The court ruled, for the first time ever, that written software code is speech protected by the First Amendment. The court further ruled that the export control laws on encryption violated Bernstein's First Amendment rights by prohibiting his constitutionally protected speech. As a result, the government changed its export regulations. Now everyone has the right to "export" encryption software -- by publishing it on the Internet -- without prior permission from the U.S. government. Once again, the Electronic Frontier Foundation led the charge to establish important cyberspace rights.

## Today's Issues

While many early battles over the right to communicate freely and privately stemmed from government censorship, today EFF is fighting for users on many other fronts as well.

Today, certain powerful corporations are attempting to shut down online speech, prevent new innovation from reaching consumers, and facilitating government surveillance. We challenge corporate overreach just as we challenge government abuses of power.

We also develop technologies that can help individuals protect their privacy and security online, which our technologists build and release freely to the public for anyone to use.

In addition, EFF is engaged in major legislative fights, beating back digital censorship bills disguised as intellectual property proposals, opposing attempts to force companies to spy on users, championing reform bills that rein in government surveillance, and much more .

We are working with advocates worldwide to create a global digital environment that upholds both human rights and Constitutional rights, and we continue to take on cutting-edge legal cases to win victories for user rights.





Legal Internship Opportunities
==============================

**Applications are now open for the Spring 2025 Intern Class, with a deadline of November 1. See below for instructions and a link to the application.**

EFF’s legal internships provide law students with a unique opportunity to develop valuable skills and real-world experience while working with a nationally-recognized public interest law firm. Legal interns learn from and assist EFF’s staff attorneys in all aspects of litigation, including legal research, factual investigation, and drafting of memoranda and briefs, while also helping with policy research, client counseling, and the development of public education materials (e.g., blog posts). Interns attend internal legal team and working group meetings, participate in legal trainings, and may have the opportunity to attend client meetings and court hearings. EFF’s docket ranges across the technological and legal landscape, from online fair use of copyrighted materials to illegal government spying; take a look at [http://www.eff.org/cases/](https://www.eff.org/cases/) and [https://www.eff.org/work](https://www.eff.org/work) for details about our work preserving constitutional values in the digital world.

All internships are time limited and align with students’ academic schedules. Summer legal internships are full-time ( **40 hours per week**) and last 10–14 weeks (typically May–August). Internships during the academic-year last one semester. For academic-year internships, we require at least **20 hours per week** for a minimum of 10 weeks.

Internships are unpaid; arrangements should be made with the student’s law school for work-study stipends or course credit. In recent years, EFF has been able to offer some limited stipends to interns who exhaust other sources of funding and will not receive course credit. Students who receive outside funding are eligible for a partial stipend to bring their total funding up to the level of EFF’s stipend amount for that term, if applicable.

### **Qualifications**

- Enrollment at, or recent graduation from, a U.S. law school - law students of all levels, including LLM students, are encouraged to apply

leez, a second-person narrative. You're quite fond of freely-modifiable and redistributable things. While compiling your college thesis on the free and open-source software movements, you rebuilt their course-management servers with free and open-source software. You are a social justice advocate that is often found evangelizing worker-run factories or encryption. Lately you also find pleasure in the ancient art of seafaring, the modern art of flash mobs, phaselocking bullymongs, and trying to make music with that electronic keyboard.

EFF's Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
====================================================

Today’s Internet is more global and diverse than ever before.

As the Internet evolves, so does EFF.

As an advocacy organization, EFF is committed to being part of a diverse community. Diversity of life experiences makes a big difference in how we identify and litigate cases, design privacy-enhancing software, and organize our activism. To that end, we have a committee dedicated to ensuring Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are core to EFF’s work and culture.

We deliberately seek applicants with different perspectives, identities, and experiences to build an inclusive workplace and inform our advocacy and defense of freedom in our digital world. EFF is an equal opportunity employer and encourages people of all races, genders, ages, abilities, orientations, ethnicities, and national origins to apply.

## Diversity

The Internet is a tool that reaches many corners of the world and allows many to have a voice. We strive to help protect all those voices, and to ensure that the tools of censorship and surveillance aren’t turned against marginalized communities. Representing these voices, experiences and points of view requires a commitment to ensuring that our organization reflects the communities affected by our work.

## Equity

Not everyone comes from the same background, nor has had the same privileges. Equity means creating systems that result in fair opportunities and outcomes for everyone, even those who have been marginalized or disempowered. We consider our work and our internal policies through the lens of equity, and seek to evolve as we learn more about systemic inequality and its impact on both technology users generally and our own staff.

## Inclusion

For diversity to flourish, the environment needs to be inclusive. To be inclusive means that we value our diversity and everyone feels welcomed. We seek to make EFF a place where people feel comfortable to be their whole selves. It means that the work does not stop with opening a door, but offering a welcoming place inside it where people can grow.





Free Speech
===========

The online world offers the promise of speech with minimal barriers and without borders. New technologies and widespread internet access have radically enhanced our ability to express ourselves; criticize those in power; gather and report the news; and make, adapt, and share creative works. Vulnerable communities have also found space to safely meet,  grow, and make themselves heard without being drowned out by the powerful. The ability to freely exchange ideas also benefits innovators, who can use all of their capabilities to build even better tools for their communities and the world.

In the U.S., the First Amendment grants individuals the right to speak without government interference. And globally, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protects the right to speak both online and offline. Everyone should be able to take advantage of this promise. And no government should have the power to decide who gets to speak and who doesn’t.

Government threats to online speakers are significant. Laws and policies have enabled censorship regimes, controlled access to information, increased government surveillance, and minimized user security and safety.

At the same time, online speakers’ reliance on private companies that facilitate their speech has grown considerably. Online services’ content moderation decisions have far-reaching impacts on speakers around the world. This includes social media platforms and online sites selectively enforcing their Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and similar rules to censor dissenting voices and contentious ideas. That’s why these services must ground their moderation decisions in human rights and due process principles.

As the law and technology develops alongside our ever-evolving world, it’s important that these neither create nor reinforce obstacles to people’s ability to speak, organize, and advocate for change. Both the law and technology must enhance people’s ability to speak. That’s why EFF fights to protect free speech - because everyone has the right to share ideas and experiences safely, especially when we disagree.





Privacy
=======

New technologies are radically advancing our freedoms, but they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of privacy. National and international laws have yet to catch up with the evolving need for privacy that comes with new digital technologies. Respect for individuals' autonomy, anonymous speech, and the right to free association must be balanced against legitimate concerns like law enforcement. EFF fights in the courts and Congress to maintain your privacy rights in the digital world, and works with partners around the globe to support the development of privacy-protecting technologies.

Your cell phone helps you keep in touch with friends and family, but it also makes it easier for the government to track your location.

Your Web searches about sensitive medical information might seem a secret between you and your search engine, but companies like Google are creating a treasure trove of personal information by logging your online activities, and making it potentially available to any party wielding enough cash or a subpoena.

And the next time you try to board a plane, watch out—you might be turned away after being mistakenly placed on a government watch list, or be forced to open your email in the security line.

Several governments have also chosen to use malware to engage in extra-legal spying or system sabotage for dissidents or non-citizens, all in the name of “national security.”

As privacy needs evolve, so too should our regulatory regimes. National governments must put legal checks in place to prevent abuse of state powers, and international bodies need to consider how a changing technological environment shapes security agencies’ best practices. Above all, we need to respect the rights of autonomy, anonymity, association, and expression that privacy makes possible, while also taking into account legitimate law enforcement concerns.

Read our work on privacy issues below, and join EFF to help support our efforts.

Creativity & Innovation
=======================

Our digital future depends on our ability to access, use, and build on technology. A few media or political interests shouldn’t have unfair technological or legal advantages over the rest of us. Unfortunately, litigious copyright and patent owners can abuse the law to inhibit fair use and stifle competition. Internet service providers can give established content companies an advantage over startups and veto the choices you make in how to use the Internet. The Electronic Frontier Foundation fights against these unfair practices and defends digital creators, inventors, and ordinary technology users. We work to protect and strengthen fair use, innovation, open access, net neutrality, and your freedom to tinker.

In principle, intellectual property laws (or IP law, a [catchall term](https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/the-term "Intellectual Property: The Term") for copyright, patents, and trademarks) should serve the public in a number of ways. Copyrights provide economic incentives for authors and artists to create and distribute new expressive works. Patents reward inventors for sharing new inventions with the public, granting them a temporary and limited monopoly on them in return for contributing to the public body of knowledge. Trademarks help protect customers by encouraging companies to make sure products match the quality standards the public expects.

Unfortunately, our IP regimes have strayed far from their original purposes. Too often, protections for free speech and innovation are seemingly forgotten as soon as someone cries “infringement.” An unproven allegation that your video or blog post infringes copyright, or that your domain name infringes someone’s trademark, can be enough to shut down perfectly lawful speech. A patent troll can kill a small company with a bogus lawsuit based on a questionable patent that shouldn’t have been issued in the first place.

Some of these laws simply haven’t adapted well to modern technology. A warped development in copyright law has made it illegal in many countries to modify or even look at the software built into the products you own, even if you’re doing it for completely lawful purposes. Copyright’s legal reinforcement of digital locks, paired with extreme criminal penalties for infringement, has intimidated a generation of would-be researchers, tinkerers, and inventors. And ongoing expansions of copyright law are often decided in secret, closed-door meetings before the public is ever allowed to debate them

Imbalanced copyright law—and overzealous enforcement—generally favors powerful voices that have a great deal of influence in culture. Extreme copyright laws can intimidate new types of creators, especially those who use new media techniques to criticize dominant culture or powerful entities. Online platforms that support new, independent creators can only thrive when they don’t risk severe legal repercussions for their users’ activities. Similarly, when only the most privileged members of society have access to up-to-date research, only those members can build on that research to create new ideas and inventions. That’s why EFF supports open access to research, so everyone can build on and contribute to our knowledge commons.

Just as new voices can’t thrive if copyright law doesn’t recognize their rights, new players must also have access to the same resources as established ones. When Internet service providers can give preferential treatment to certain content or hardware companies, those technologies harden to the accelerating effect of competition and users can’t access new sources of information and innovative new services. EFF believes that Internet users should have the freedom to use technology however they like without service providers artificially restricting their experience.

Whether we’re fighting patent trolls in court; arguing in Congress for more balanced copyright laws; or urging governments, funders, and educational institutions to adopt open access policies, EFF is committed to building a society that supports creativity and innovation, where established players in the marketplace for technology and culture aren’t allowed to silence the next generation of creators.





Transparency
============

Knowing “what the government is up to” is often the first step in ensuring that the government respects the civil liberties of its citizens. Transparency is especially important given the government’s increasingly secretive use of new technologies for law enforcement and national security purposes. From cell phone location tracking, the use of surveillance drones, secret interpretations of electronic surveillance law, and the expanding use of biometrics, EFF wants to hold the government accountable and uphold your digital rights.

To that aim, EFF’s transparency work is dedicated to using federal and state freedom of information laws, the courtroom, and our megaphone to shine light on government activities.

One of the major tools we use is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a federal law that gives people the right to request information kept by federal government agencies. Our team of FOIA lawyers also submit requests on a variety of digital civil liberties issues and often take cases to court when we believe the government is unduly withholding information. But anyone can make a request under FOIA, and you can go here to learn how you can submit your own.

While emerging technologies give the government new tools that threaten citizen civil liberties, technology also has the potential to create a more democratic relationship between public institutions and the citizens they serve. Today, a broad range of new tools are allowing the public to more closely examine government and corporate entities and to hold them accountable for deception, censorship, and corruption. In addition to using freedom of information laws to shed light on government actions, EFF also wants to highlight technologies that _help_ the transparency process —whether it’s making it easier to file and track FOIA requests, websites dedicated to whistleblowing, or open government initiatives that can improve access to information.





International
=============

EFF's international team advocates for privacy, free speech, and an open Internet in international venues and across the world. We expose mass and unwarranted surveillance, and educate unlawfully targeted users on how to protect themselves and their colleagues. We use individual cases globally to highlight the effect of technology on human rights, and defend technologists from persecution and detention wherever they live.

### Ensuring users' voices are heard in global policymaking

Internet users are impacted not only by rules and policies made in their own country, but those made around the world. EFF's international team fights to make sure that Internet users are heard in these processes. They include copyright treaties developed by the [World Intellectual Property Organization](https://www.eff.org/issues/wipo) (WIPO), trade agreements such as the now-defeated [Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) (TPP), domain name policies developed by [ICANN](https://www.eff.org/issues/icann), and increasingly, a [shadowy web](https://www.eff.org/issues/shadow-regulation) of cross-border industry agreements forged in corporate backrooms.

Where international bodies lack an adequate rights-based framework for their deliberations, EFF also works to fill the gap by developing global principles such as the [Manila Principles for Intermediary Liability](https://www.manilaprinciples.org/) and the [Necessary and Proportionate principles](https://necessaryandproportionate.org/). We use these to promote users' rights on the global stage in bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://www.eff.org/issues/oecd) (OECD) and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).

### Fighting unchecked surveillance laws and norms

We fight [laws and treaties](https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards) that seek to legitimize [mass surveillance](https://www.eff.org/issues/surveillance-human-rights) and weaken civil liberties and transparency. We work to spotlight privacy violations throughout the world and defend against influential governments seeking to increase law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ power. EFF fends off proposals for [mandatory data retention](https://www.eff.org/issues/mandatory-data-retention), wiretapping-friendly legislation, national identity schemes, [biometrics initiatives](https://www.eff.org/issues/biometrics), and invasive location tracking. EFF works with [digital rights organizations](https://www.eff.org/csss) around the globe to fight for privacy, and  pressure telecommunications companies to protect the privacy of their customers.

### Exposing Institutional Censorship

EFF recognizes that much of today’s free expression takes place on corporate platforms, which apply their own rules and are subject to the legal requirements of different jurisdictions. While in recent years most major companies have produced transparency reports that show content takedowns made at the behest of government actors, there is little to no transparency regarding takedowns made on the basis of terms of service. Furthermore, companies often prohibit certain legal content, such as nudity.

We encourage social media companies to operate with greater transparency and accountability. To that end, we partner with Visualizing Impact on [Onlinecensorship.org](https://onlinecensorship.org/), which collects reports from users in an effort to shine a light on content takedowns. We also regularly advocate for companies to make policy changes, particularly when their policies result in discriminatory practices.

### Protecting vulnerable populations from digital attacks

EFF works to protect vulnerable populations from digital attacks. We seek to compensate for the asymmetry between powerful attackers and  targets who do not necessarily have a strong, technical understanding of digital security or a team of experts at their disposal. We research the threats that these populations face, such as [state-sponsored malware](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware).  We raise awareness of digital privacy and security issues through our [Surveillance Self-Defense project](https://ssd.eff.org/) and conduct security trainings based on these materials. We also defend the rights of security researchers through our work on [export controls](https://www.eff.org/issues/export-controls) and EFF's [Coders Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders). so that these researchers can continue to contribute to the safety and security of vulnerable populations.

### Defending Technologists and Censored Voices Across The World

Throughout its history, EFF has defended those who have been unfairly targeted with prosecution and detention simply because they used technology to exercise their civil liberties. With our [Offline project](https://www.eff.org/offline), EFF seeks to highlight the international cases of individuals who have used technology to speak out against abuse, or have built and shared technology that protects or extends human rights, and have been imprisoned as a result. We work with the communities that support these prisoners of conscience, draw attention to their predicament, and work for their release.





Security
========

Computer security and the lack of computer security is a fundamental issue that underpins much of how the Internet does (and doesn't) function. Many of the policy issues that EFF works on are linked to security in deep ways including privacy and anonymity, DRM, censorship, and network neutrality.

EFF works directly on a wide range of security issues including increased deployment of cryptographic protocols through projects like [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/); improving the security of those protocols; offering legal assistance to researchers through our [Coders' Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders); offering practical security advice to activists through the [surveillance self-defense](https://ssd.eff.org) project; and working on the development of new security standards.

Other Ways to Give
==================

Show your support and start conversations about online rights with EFF stickers, apparel, and more.

EFF is one of several, carefully selected Human and Civil Rights Organizations across the country that federal, some state and local employees can donate through payroll deductions. We are proud that so many government employees decide to support digital civil liberties as part of the annual Combined Federal Campaign, and would be happy to provide you with more information about how you can contribute, or visit their site at [http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html](http://www.hcr.org/our-members.html).

**EFF’s CFC Code is 10437.**

Even if you’re not a government employee, you can participate by representing EFF at local campaign events and fairs. Please contact Maggie Kazmierczak, EFF’s Membership Coordinator, at maggie@eff.org for training and informational materials to distribute at an event near your hometown.

Many workplaces match their employees’ charitable gifts, meaning EFF will receive anywhere from 50% to 200% in additional contributions, as long as you report the donation to your employer. There are usually three steps to the process:

EFF will take it from there. If you want to help your colleagues, please add a description of the matching gifts procedure at your company and links to any forms available online at [https://eff.org/match](https://www.eff.org/match).

### **Legacy Giving**

Create a Legacy through the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Long-Term Investment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties

There are many ways you can make a significant gift to EFF that will provide you with tax savings and other benefits. Depending upon your unique financial planning objectives, you can be a major supporter of EFF using any or all of the giving methods described below. It is important, regardless of the size of your estate, to have a properly executed plan to ensure that you, not the courts, determine who will receive your property upon your death. When you create a will or living trust with a qualified advisor, attorney, accountant and/or financial planner, you ensure that your intentions are carried out. You are also ensuring that the needs of the people and organizations you care about will be met. The Development Office is prepared to work closely with you and your financial advisors to explain the benefits of each gift category. We encourage you to consult with your tax advisor for specific information about your own estate and financial planning goals.

### Bequests

The amount of a bequest gift is fully deductible for estate tax purposes. Gifts of securities, real property, and business interests may be made as bequests. Some sample language you can use to include EFF in your estate plan: "I bequeath to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, California 94109, the sum of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ($) dollars for its general purposes."

### Gifts of Life Insurance

By naming EFF the owner and beneficiary of an existing policy, you receive a tax deduction for the cash surrender value. You may also decide to make EFF the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. If you make gifts to EFF in the amount of the policy's premiums, you can take a charitable income tax deduction (provided EFF is not obligated to use the payments to cover the policy's premium).

### Retirement Plans

You can name EFF as a beneficiary of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 401 (k) Plan, 403 (b) Plan, Qualified Pension Plan, or Qualified Profit-Sharing Plan. Transferring these assets to a family member at the death of the plan participant may trigger two potential federal taxes: estate tax and income tax. When a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, the combination of these taxes could consume most of the assets intended for transfer. Since EFF is a tax-exempt organization, we do not have to pay taxes on the income from the plan. Your plan administrator can provide you with a beneficiary form.

### Financial Accounts

By including EFF as a beneficiary of a bank account, brokerage account, mutual fund account, or an asset such as a certificate of deposit (CD), you can provide a legacy gift to support our work. Your estate would receive a charitable deduction equal to the amount of the gift. Simply fill out a beneficiary designation form obtained from the institution holding your account.

### Specific language for a bequest

### **Online Purchases: [eBay](http://givingworks.ebay.com/), [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/)**

### **Stock Donations**

A gift of appreciated stock generally offers a twofold tax savings. First, you avoid paying any capital gains tax on the increase in the value of the stock. Second, you receive a charitable income tax deduction for the fair market value of the stock on the date it is transferred. Make sure you have owned the stock for a "long-term" period (more than 12 months) to qualify for these tax advantages. Gifts of appreciated stock are fully deductible--up to a maximum of 30% of your adjusted gross income. Please check with your accountant or tax advisor regarding your particular tax status.

All material that is not original to EFF may require permission from the copyright holder to redistribute.

You do NOT have to ask permission to post original EFF material on a mailing list or newsgroup, to use an EFF logo as a pointer to us on your web site, or to reprint an EFF statement in a newspaper article. **Permission to do such things is explicitly granted.** Please do **not** write to us asking for permission, as this wastes our time and yours.

If you redistribute something you got from the EFF site, it is appreciated if you make it known where the file originated, so people can get more info or updated versions.

## Copyright Infringement Notification

If you believe there is content on the EFF website that violates copyright law, let us know. Specifically, send us an email or letter that includes substantially the following:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
- Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
- A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

The notice should be sent to our designated agent, Corynne McSherry, via email (dmca-notice@eff.org) or fax (415-436-9993).

We may display a copy of your DMCA notice in place of the removed content.

Note: Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages. One company that sent an infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees under this provision. See http://www.eff.org/cases/online-policy-group-v-diebold. In addition, “in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with “a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law,” the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright.” Lenz v. Universal, 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1155 (2008)

EFF reserves the right to review the allegedly infringing material and independently determine whether it is infringing.

Please also note that the information provided in this legal notice will be forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content. A copy of this legal notice may also be sent (with your personal information removed) to a third-party that may publish and/or annotate it for noncommercial research and educational purposes.

## Counter-Notification: What You Can Do If Your Content Was Removed

If you believe material you posted to EFF’s site was not infringing, you can submit a counter-notice. If you need assistance in determining whether the material was not infringing, please contact our Intake Coordinator (via email at info@eff.org), who may be able to help you find an independent attorney to evaluate your situation.

A counter-notification must include the following:

- Identification of the specific URLs of material that EFF has removed or to which EFF has disabled access.
- Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address.
- The statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which EFF is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant." EFF is located in the Northern District of California.
- The statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."

A scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature is fine.

Please send your counter-notice to Corynne McSherry, via email (dmca-notice@eff.org) or fax (415-436-9993)

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. If you are concerned about protecting your anonymity, please consult with an attorney about other options.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 business days that the claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on EFF’s site. If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, generally we will reinstate the material.

Please also be advised that in appropriate circumstances we terminate repeat infringers.





Trademark and Brand Usage Policy
================================

Welcome to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (“EFF”) Trademark and Brand Usage Policy. This policy is designed to answer the most common questions we receive regarding use of our EFF trademarks, to provide our community with clear guidance, and to enable you to make certain uses of our EFF trademarks without the need to seek our individual, written permission in each instance.

EFF has, [on](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/eff-jones-day-dont-be-trademark-bully) [many](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dear-google-parody-not-trademark-infringement) [occasions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/eff-court-trademark-not-censorship-tool), demanded that companies and other organizations tolerate legal, fair uses of their trademarks, including those uses that parody or criticize the organization in question. Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any right you may have to use EFF’s trademarks in a manner that is otherwise allowed by law, including to criticize EFF or to parody our organization or our work.

## What are Trademarks?

Trademarks are best thought of as a type of consumer protection law: they help those seeking goods and services efficiently differentiate one supplier from another. The term “trademark” includes any word, name, symbol, or device – or any combination of those – that is used by a person or entity to identify and distinguish their goods and services from those offered by others, and to indicate the source or origin of their goods and services. So, for example, you can tell if your computer operating system originated in Redmond or in Cupertino by referencing the operating system’s trademark and branding; and neither Microsoft nor Apple can adopt the brands of the other, because such use would typically cause confusion among consumers. In the U.S., and in many other jurisdictions, it is not required to register a trademark with the government before claiming rights in the mark.

## What are EFF Trademarks?

The EFF trademarks (collectively, the “EFF Marks”) are all trademarks owned or used by EFF, including but not limited to:

1. our ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION® trademark
2. our EFF® trademark
3. our PRIVACY BADGER® trademark
4. our CERTBOT® trademark
5. our "EFF Logo" Design trademark

![EFF logo 2018](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/07/10/eff-logo-lockup-black.png)
6. our “EFF Meatball” Design® trademark

![EFF small logo](https://www.eff.org/files/2017/09/07/meatball.png)
7. our “Certbot” Design trademark

![certbot logo](https://www.eff.org/files/2017/09/07/certbot.png)

This list may be updated as other trademarks are created or registered.

## In Which Situations May I Use the EFF Marks?

_To Truthfully Identify EFF and Our Products and Services_

Consistent with our position favoring the free exchange of ideas and information, and favoring limitations on the ability of trademark owners to stifle speech with which they disagree, nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights you may have to use EFF’s Marks in a manner that is otherwise allowed by law.

For example, trademark law (including pursuant to the “nominative fair use” doctrine) allows you to make non-trademark use of the EFF Marks to truthfully refer to or identify the EFF and its products and services. So, you don’t need our permission to write about why you love (or hate) our advocacy work, to inform others of the origin of our Certbot software, or the like.

Your intended use may be a nominative fair use if:

1.  it’s not easy to identify the product or company without using a mark (e.g., using the term “Chicago Bulls” instead of “the basketball team that plays in Chicago” is acceptable);
2. only so much is used as is necessary to identify the product or company and to accomplish your purpose; and
3. you do nothing to suggest the mark-owner has endorsed or sponsored your use.

_Personal, Non-Commercial Uses on Affinity Products_

You may use the EFF Marks without asking our permission on products like t-shirts and stickers that express your affinity for our organization, provided that: (1) your use is non-commercial in nature and you give the products away for free; (2) your use is not misleading and not likely to cause confusion as to whether EFF sponsored, endorsed, or was otherwise involved in creating or offering your products; and (3) if you are offering more than 50 units, you do not advertise or offer the products online.

If you want to sell affinity products (even if you’re just charging a nominal fee to cover your costs), want to give away more than 50 units online, or want to make any other uses not specifically permitted here, you must obtain our written permission first.

## In Which Situations May I NOT Use the EFF Marks?

In any situation not specifically listed above, and where you are not otherwise legally permitted to do so, you must ask us for permission before using our trademarks. For example, you may not use our EFF Marks in the following situations:

_Uses that are Confusing, False, or Misleading_

You may not use any EFF Mark in a manner that is false or misleading, or in a manner likely to confuse consumers or the public about the source or origin of your products or services. Confusing uses include uses that may cause people to think your products or services are EFF’s products or services, or vice versa, or that may imply a formal affiliation between you and EFF where none exists. Unless we have done so in writing, EFF has not officially sponsored or endorsed your product or service, and you should not imply that we have.

You may not use the EFF Marks in, or as a part of, any trade name, trademark, domain name, or internet account name that is likely to cause confusion. So, the business name or trademark “EFF Activist Tool,” or the Twitter handle “@EFFActivistTool,” are not permitted, because folks who see those uses are likely to assume that they are official EFF services or accounts, or to assume that their owner is officially sponsored or endorsed by EFF. By the same token, the domain name “EFF-Activist-Tools.com,” or the Facebook group “EFF Activist Tools,” would also be likely to cause confusion.

That said, the purpose of trademark law is to address confusion, and uses that misleadingly suggest affiliation where none exists: not to silence legitimate criticism, commentary, or parody. For example, if you were to use an @EFF\_sucks Twitter account to voice criticism of our organization, that is probably not something the public would view as an official EFF account, and no permission would be required for a use of that nature.

## Uses of EFF Marks in Connection with Derivative Software

EFF offers a few software products to the community on a free and open source basis (our “Open Source Products”), which means that you can alter and modify the source code of e.g., our Certbot project to better suit your needs. We encourage you to do so! And, nothing in this policy is intended to limit your ability to tinker with, improve, and modify our open source software in any manner.

However, from a trademark point of view, software that you have modified is different from the software that originates from EFF, and you may not brand any derivative software with an EFF Mark, even if you make only minor changes to it, except as provided below (repackaging). For example, if you modify our Certbot software, you are free to distribute that modification broadly, but you may not distribute the Derivative Software under the Certbot brand, or under any brand that is confusingly similar to “Certbot” or to any other EFF Mark, unless your modification constitutes a repackaging as defined below. For example, use of “Certbot for Plan 9” or “EFF Certbot Fork” as trademarks or in advertising your Derivative Software is otherwise expressly prohibited.

You can, however, use the EFF Marks to truthfully describe your own products or services in a descriptive, non-trademark sense. For example, if you offer a software product that adds features to one of our Open Source Products, you may use an EFF trademark like “Certbot” to describe the fact that your software is based on Certbot. So, statements like “based on Certbot,” “forked from Certbot,” or “derived from Certbot,” would be permitted to the extent they’re accurate. However, using EFF’s logos or designs, or otherwise making a trademark-type use of the EFF Marks would not be permitted.

If you produce a plugin that is compatible with one of our Open Source Products, you may use the Open Source Product’s trademark as part of the filename for your plugin, though we ask that you also include your own name in the filename (for example, “certbot-yournamehere-s3front”), to avoid confusion with official EFF plugins. We also ask that you provide appropriate attribution to EFF as the source of the original Open Source Product in any NOTICE, README, LICENSE, or similar file in your distribution, and as appropriate elsewhere in your source code.

## Uses of EFF Marks in Connection with New Software Packages

“Packaging” software, or creating a new software package, refers to the process of modifying the original source code of software solely for the purpose of enabling that software to function in a different operating system environment (e.g., modifying its libraries, dependencies, etc.), made without modifying the functionality and/or objectives of the original software product. As noted above, you are generally not permitted to use our EFF Marks in connection with software derived from our Open Source Products. But, if you are only creating a new package of an Open Source Product, like Certbot or Privacy Badger, for use on a particular operating system, we grant you permission to use the Marks, provided that you do each of the following:

1. You may use the mark only when packaging the particular Open Source Product it refers to. For example, if you are creating a Certbot package for a new operating system, you may use only the Certbot trademark in connection with that package; nothing in this section is intended to give you additional rights or licenses to use the EFF word mark or the “EFF Meatball” Design.
2. You may only use the word mark (e.g., Certbot) and not any design marks, logos, or the like, that may be associated with the Open Source Product you are packaging. For example, you may not use our Certbot Design trademark, shown above, in connection with packaging Certbot software.
3. You may use the mark only in connection with packaging an Open Source Product for use with the particular operating system specified in your request (as explained below), and only where you are making no significant or functional change to the software. If you’d like to make significant or functional changes to the software, and would like to offer your software under an EFF Mark, please contact us, as described below ( _see What If I Want Permission For A Use Not Allowed By This Policy?_). This process allows us to work with developers who are planning new features and ensures we can catch any quality, security or compatibility issues that may arise from planned functional changes.
4. Any package you create using an EFF Mark must be of high quality, and in particular must meet any standards of quality that we establish, and as we may change from time to time. We reserve the right to request changes if your software deviates from our quality standards, and your continued use of all EFF Marks is expressly conditioned on your prompt implementation of such changes.
5. EFF has the right to audit any software whose trademark you use pursuant to the permission granted in this section. In particular, upon EFF’s request you must provide us with a link to the project source code e.g., at GitHub, and/or any advertising associated with the product, so that we can audit it periodically to ensure its quality, compatibility with the upstream version, etc. If you decide to cease active development of your package, you agree to let us know about that too. Please keep us updated on the status of your package going forward, and let us know if the person maintaining the project changes.
6. Consistent with the other elements of this policy, please don’t do anything to imply a greater level of sponsorship by or affiliation with EFF than actually exists.
7. Before using any EFF Mark in connection with any package, we ask that you please first contact EFF at packaging\[@\]eff.org to provide (1) the name of the software you are packaging, and the operating system(s) you are packaging it for; (2) your contact information; (3) a link to your project’s source code and, if you have one, project website; and (4) a description of how you intend to use the EFF Marks in connection with your package. This is requested, **but not required** if you are simply using the EFF software as is, or if you are using your own name for your software project, and only using the EFF Mark to to truthfully describe your own products or services in a descriptive, non-trademark sense (i.e. statements like “based on Certbot” or “forked from Certbot”).  Even when we require advance notice, you need not wait for a response from us before starting to use the EFF Mark in connection with your project, but as noted above we reserve the right to control the quality of projects that use an EFF Mark, so we may follow up with specific requests.  To be clear, this policy is simply about ensuring that software named with an EFF Mark meets high quality standards, it does not require you to do anything to take advantage of our open software licenses under your own branding.

Repackagers help us get our products out to as many people as possible, and we value your service to the community. Thank you!

## What If I Want Permission For A Use Not Allowed By This Policy?

If you wish to use any of the EFF Marks in a manner that is not expressly permitted by this policy, or otherwise permitted by a trademark law exception such as fair use, please contact us directly at info\[at\]eff.org. We will be happy to consider your request. For most efficient processing of your request, your email should:

1. provide plenty of detail regarding the requested use (e.g., “I’d like to sell 100 hoodies at an upcoming technology meetup occurring on April 5, 2063”);
2. contain a mockup of the use you plan to make, so that we can review it (e.g., “enclosed is a .png version of the design that I’d like to use on the back of the hoodies I plan to offer”);
3. be clear as to timing and when you require approval (e.g., “I need to order the garments no later than February 5, 2063”); and
4.  let us know whether the goods you plan to produce will be given away for free, or how you anticipate pricing them, if applicable.

We ask that you submit any such requests to us at least four (4) weeks before you require approval.

If you plan to make a profit on your use – for example, if you’ll be charging more for your hoodies than they cost to produce – we’ll likely ask you to agree to donate any profits you end up with (if any) to EFF.

## If I Have Permission to Use an EFF Mark, What Are the Usage Restrictions for That Trademark?

Use the Exact Mark. EFF’s trademarks should be used in their exact, most up-to-date form. They should neither be abbreviated nor combined with other words.

Mark the Mark. The first or most prominent use of an EFF Mark should be accompanied by a “tm” symbol (“™”), to indicate that it is a trademark; you may also use the “r in a circle” symbol (“®”), if the trademark in question is a registered trademark. If you aren’t sure, using the “tm” symbol (“™”) is fine. The first or most prominent mention of an EFF Mark should also be set apart from surrounding text, either by capitalizing, italicizing, bolding, or underlining it.

Credit the Mark. The following notice text should appear somewhere nearby your first or most prominent mention of an EFF Mark (for example in a footer). If that’s not practical, you may include it in a reasonable alternate location:

_\[mark\] is a trademark of the Electronic Frontier Foundation._

Any goodwill generated by use of the EFF Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of EFF.

## How Do I Report Trademark Abuse?

Please report any misuse of the EFF Marks to info\[at\]eff.org, and provide us with as much information as you can about the use you think might be infringing. We’ll investigate the use, and take appropriate action, if warranted.

## Questions?

If you’d like to use the EFF Marks in a way that’s not covered by this policy, or if you have any questions regarding this policy or the use of our trademarks overall, please contact us at info\[at\]eff.org. Please note that it may take **four (4) weeks** for such requests to be processed.





Privacy Policy
==============

(Note that EFF's Technology Projects, such as HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Badger, and Certbot, have a different privacy policy, available [here](https://www.eff.org/code/privacy/policy))

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and volunteers. EFF has established this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our websites and how it is used, as well as protections for our members’ and donors’ personal information.

In this policy, "EFF" refers to EFF staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep confidential information they receive as part of their assistance to EFF.

EFF does not sell or rent member, donor or website visitor information under any circumstances, and we do not share member, donor or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law. This restriction applies to member and donors who join or donate both online and offline. (See discussion below.)

EFF is located within the United States, and therefore will transfer, process, and store your information in the United States, which may not provide as much protection as your home country. (We’re [working](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) to make US practices better.)

## Information Gathered by EFF's Site

**Logging:** For visitors to our website, we generally log only timestamps, URLs, and HTTP requests and do internal analytical logging, including additional technical information such as a single byte from IP addresses (described [further below](https://www.eff.org/policy#analytics)), for up to seven days from when the data was collected.

Circumstances in which EFF may need to log and retain technical information for longer than seven days include when we believe it is reasonably necessary for EFF’s mission and functionality, including situations such as:

- site testing,

- diagnosis of technical problems,

- defending against attacks to the site,

- handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal, short-term circumstances, or

- research projects (in anonymized form) that serve our overall mission to defend freedom online.

In those and similar situations we will delete the information as soon as it is apparent that the information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was retained. For more information on EFF's position on data logging and techniques we use to anonymize, obfuscate, aggregate and delete information, see our [Best Practices for Online Service Providers](https://www.eff.org/wp/osp).

**How EFF Internal Analytics Works:** EFF endeavors to gather sufficient information for analyzing our website and how visitors move within it without compromising the privacy of our visitors.  EFF’s internal analytical logging involves logging for up to seven days a single byte of the IP address, as well as the referrer page, time stamp, page requested, user agent, language header, website visited, and a hash of all of this information. After seven days we keep only aggregate information from these logs. We also geolocate IP addresses before anonymizing them and store only the country.

**Cookies:** We do not use persistent ID cookies on this site except where you click “remember me” or are logged in, as you can be for the Action Center. We use session cookies on certain portions of the website. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. You can use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) if you wish to keep your connection information anonymous, but please note that you can still be identified to EFF if you log in.

**Voluntarily Submitted Information:** In addition, EFF collects and retains information you voluntarily submit to us. It is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much information to provide. If you choose to become an EFF member, use the EFF Shop, otherwise donate to EFF or use our Action Center, we may ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, mailing address and phone number and will retain that information. For online donors and shoppers, we also ask for your credit card number or other payment information. For the Action Center, we maintain aggregate information about participation in the action campaigns, and, if you agree, we will also maintain account-specific records of your use of the Action Center. If you use the EFF Shop, you are asked to provide personal information, such as a shipping address, necessary to complete your transaction.

We may ask for additional personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or otherwise communicate with us. We are pleased to receive anonymous donations in the mail or in-person, but please note that your personal information may be required if you choose to donate using our online form, or if you choose to use a mobile payment processor for in-person donations (and the mobile payment processor will also receive your payment information, subject to their privacy policy.)

From time to time, we may ask for personal information on other portions of the site, such as asking you to sign a petition, participate in a contest, or provide prior art for a patent busting project.

**EFFector and other Mailing Lists:** If you choose to subscribe to EFFector, our free electronic newsletter or any of our other mailing lists, we collect your email address, and, if you choose to provide it, a zip or postal code.

## EFF's Use of Information

In general, EFF uses the information provided by you to further its mission, including to protect privacy, defend freedom and innovation, and to protect your rights in the digital world **.**

**Member and Donor Information:** We use member and donor information for our legitimate interest in processing and managing your membership or contribution, including fundraising reminders and renewals. If you agree, we will use your email address to send you updates and alerts on protecting your rights in the digital world, so you may take action, such as contacting your representative in Congress or attending an event. If you choose to complete the "Please tell us why you became a member of EFF" field when donating, this information may be shared with the entire EFF staff and board, and select unattributed quotes may be used to promote our mission, such as including a relevant quote in a grant proposal.

Action Center: We use the information you supply in our Action Center to help you take action in support of digital civil liberties, such as contacting decision makers (e.g. a representative in Congress) and their staff, signing a petition or sharing a message on social media. We may use Action Center information to assess the success of action campaigns and to improve the functionality and effectiveness of our site, and to allow you to see records of your activities.We, and our coalition partners, may publicize and share aggregate information about action campaigns, such as the number of people who participated in a particular location or region or through a type of action, as well as sharing or publicizing activity trends.

**Publication by EFF:** If you provide information for publication we may use your name and contact information you have provided to us to provide you with attribution.

**Other activities:** We may run surveys, contests, or similar activities through this site. Such information will be used for the purposes for which it was collected. We use the information provided through our online shop to fulfill your order, and address any problems that might arise. We also look at technical information to diagnose problems with or consider improvements to our servers or related technologies and to administer eff.org and other websites we host or provide.

## Third-Party Service Providers to EFF

Portions of the eff.org site, including some of our individual action alert webpages, are operated by third-parties, such as grassroots campaign service providers. When necessary and appropriate, EFF uses the following categories of third party services:

- content delivery networks and cloud hosting providers (for example, hosting and handling traffic to our site).

- Financial services and payment processors (for example, your credit card and online payments)

- cloud email providers (for example, sending you email, like the EFFector newsletter)

- shipping and fulfillment services (for example, shipping you our [great swag](https://supporters.eff.org/shop))


Where possible, we take steps to limit the ability of third parties to retain data about our users. These service providers may place session cookies on your computer. EFF’s service providers may also log standard technical information, such as the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. Our service providers may also store and organize the personal information collected through this site on our behalf. EFF’s third party providers primarily process information in the United States, but may process data in other jurisdictions. Where applicable, we have entered into [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR) compliant Data Protection Addendums with third-parties who process data on our behalf.

In addition, for all of EFF's service providers, hosting providers and credit card processors and any other providers we may use in the future, the information collected from EFF users remains protected by the terms of our agreements with those providers and we will ensure that the information to be kept confidential and disclosed only to employees who require such access in the course of their assigned duties. EFF also requires all of our third-party service providers to notify EFF if they receive legal process seeking information about visitors to EFF’s website.

EFF may change the specific third-party providers from time to time, and will transfer stored information to any new provider subject to similar restrictions and agreements. From time to time, EFF may work with third-party consultants or other service providers who may have access to personally identifiable information. In such cases, we will restrict their use of personally identifiable information in accordance with their assigned tasks.

## Third-Party Services and APIs

EFF’s site also provides links to or interacts with a wide variety of third-party websites, including interactive links to sites like social media, telephone calling services, mapping services, or video hosting websites, often via application programming interfaces ( [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api)). EFF is not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties.

We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited via links from or interactions with the EFF website. Where appropriate, we will provide specific notice of these third-party services at the point of interaction. It is our policy not to include third-party resources when users initially load our web pages, but we may dynamically include them later after giving the user a chance to choose to interact with them. If you believe a third-party resource is automatically loading, please let us know so we can address it.

## Disclosure of Your Information

While EFF endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper and we have done so.

## Updating or Removing Your Information

You may choose to correct, update, access, or delete the membership information you have submitted to us by sending an email requesting changes to membership@eff.org. If you join the Action Center, you may correct, update, access, or delete the information provided on the account management page.

Your consent to our use of your information is very important to us. If you would like to withdraw your consent to receive the EFFector newsletter, Action Alerts and other bulk emails, you may use this [subscription management page](https://supporters.eff.org/account) to unsubscribe. If you would like to otherwise withdraw your consent, restrict or object to EFF’s processing of your data, please email [privacypolicy@eff.org](mailto:privacypolicy@eff.org).

## Data Storage and Retention

EFF’s server logs are stored and retained as explained above in the section on logging.

Information submitted through our Action Center, including records of the actions you take, is retained until you choose to delete your account. Email subscriptions information is retained until you unsubscribe from the mailing list(s).

If you communicate with EFF, such as through [info@eff.org](mailto:info@eff.org), we keep records of those communications indefinitely, pursuant to our document retention policy (described below).

Financial records of donations and other transactions are retained indefinitely, pursuant to our document retention policy. Paper records of donations, such as event donation forms and signup sheets, are typically destroyed soon after entry. Check copies and payment distribution details are normally kept up to seven years. Accompanying donor information is kept indefinitely unless the individual requests that it be removed.

Our document retention policy provides that EFF generally retains documents for the period of their immediate or current use, unless longer retention is necessary to comply with contractual or legal requirements. However, data storage periods are based on EFF's assessment of its needs and might include retaining some documents for historical reference and retaining some documents because EFF has insufficient organizational resources available to dedicate to their review and destruction, and/or other pertinent factors.

If we inadvertently collect more personal information than intended, we endeavor to delete the extraneous information. When we no longer need to retain information or when deleting information on request, we endeavor to remove all copies. However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media.

## Contacting EFF

If you have any questions about our privacy and data protection practices, you can reach EFF at:

Electronic Frontier Foundation

If our processing of your personal data is covered by EU law, you may also lodge a complaint with the relevant [data protection supervisory authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm) for your country of residence.

## Security

EFF employs industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, such as the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, data backup systems, and engaging security professionals to evaluate our systems effectiveness. EFF has turned on [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) by default.

Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by EFF in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.

## Changes to Our Policies

EFF's Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with EFF's mission. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will place notice in EFFector and post notice of changes on this page.

_Updated July 1, 2022 to reflect that EFF no longer uses_ [_Cryptolog_](https://github.com/efforg/cryptolog) _, which allowed us to take the IP address portion of the request getting logged and encrypt it, as well as a chunk of random data (the salt), using a cryptographic hash function. Instead, as described above, we generally don’t log IP_ _addresses_ _at all._

_Updated May 25, 2018 to provide more transparency about our privacy practices and more detailed information about how you can access, correct and remove personal data stored with EFF._

_Updated February 20, 2018 to clarify how EFF works with third parties like content delivery networks and cloud service providers._

_Updated July 14, 2016 to clarify the use of information in the EFF Action Center and protections for members who join EFF offline._

_Updated_ _April 7, 2015 to reflect: 1) changes to the types of third-party service providers which may be used by EFF websites; 2) that third-party service providers may be used by any EFF site, not just those on the eff.org domain; and 3) to fix some typographical errors._

_Updated_ _June 12, 2014 to reflect: 1) changes to reflect EFF’s new Action Center, including the consequences for logging in or clicking “remember me,” the identifying information we retain about logged in users and how to manage your account; 2) information use by purchasers in our Shop; 3) a specific section addressing EFF’s use of Third Party Services and API’s._

_Also recently updated May 1, 2014 to reflect: 1) introduction of EFF's separate Technology Projects Privacy Policy; 2) specifying that we will try to give prior notice to users when someone seeks their data from us and that we have actually challenged requests for access to our user information; 3) clarifying that we will ensure that information we give to third parties is protected, even if that is not through a specific agreement (it may, for example, be because the third party does not engage in logging)._
